2012-02-07 14:47:51,"Hi guys, some advice please.  Harrison has been on a slow wean off of Maxidex for the last 6 weeks (2 drops a day).  He has had a really bad virus which I thought would have affected his eyes but at the hospital on Friday they said that his eyes were quiet.  However, the pressure is now borderline and they can see the start of cateracts.  They took him off Maxidex immediately and he is on Vexol three times a day.  I knew this day may come as they couldnt keep him on Maxidex forever. Does Vexol have any side effects?  Is it just weaker that Maxidex.  I always come out of these appointments with questions I should have asked!! I am keeping positive but really scared what comes next as they said he may flare up.  I am hoping that he won't but not sure what happens next if he does.  His vision is fine at the moment.  Any advice on the next steps would really help as back to Moorfields next week.

It's much less likely to raise pressure. If Harrison flares on the three drops of Vexol, they may increase the number of drops a day, try a different steroid such as Predsol (medium strength) or Lotemax (not supposed to raise pressure). Alternatively, you may be told to revert back to Maxidex and use a pressure lowering drop to keep pressure down. What happens with the choice of drops largely depends on the severity of any flare.","The cataracts caused by steroid are often very slow growing and it may be years before they require removal, especially if steroid drops are used infrequently.","We are all often scared of what comes next and if you are worried that immunosuppressant treatment is the next step for Harrison, then it might be a good idea to discuss this at your appointment next week.",topic_1256351,Quiet Eyes but Pressure Up,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2012-02-08 08:52:52,"Hi Tanya,",I can't really add anything to Maxine's comments as she's covered it all!

My daughter (Rebecca) is not doing too bad thank you. She seems to be tolerating the steroid drops and methatrexate very well. She is due a check up next Monday but we had to go to eye casualty yesterday as her right eye was painful. She had been on timolol drops to lower the high pressure in that eye. Good job we got it checked out as her pressure had dropped to very low pressure. We also found that her sight in her right eye had detiorated due to the cataract having developed further. Her left eye is responding well and there has been some improvement. We have to wait for a period of 3 months with no inflammation before they can operate. We attended a joint Uveitis and Methatrexate education session on Saturday run by our Opthalmic Surgeon and our Rheumatologist. It was a very informative session and I got to meet other families with children who have JIA and Uveitis. Has Riley had the blood test that you mentioned in your earlier post?,Paul,topic_3753785,My 7 yr old daughter just diagnosed with Chronic Bilateral Uveitis - Help,https://www.paypal.com/webapps/auth/user/2e769e539de2d38e4ee7a1b504fdfc516829f6c817f77e89833bfd0e0d98bfeb,Talbopa,2014-04-16 14:17:51,"Paul,",topic_3753785,My 7 yr old daughter just diagnosed with Chronic Bilateral Uveitis - Help,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/100006853813281/,RebeccaSalter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My 7yr old daughter suffered JIA in her left knee some 4yrs ago. She was treated with steroid injections and the symptoms were relieved. She had 1 eye check during her initial treatment but I was not made aware of the requirement for 3 monthly screening and indeed the rheumatology team noted to our GP that future problems with her eyes were unlikely. I have now been informed by our current opthalmic surgeon that the uveitis has most probably been present for approx 2 years. My daughters visual acuity was measured at 3/60 in her right eye and 4/60 in her left eye. I am very angry that our life has been turned upside down again just 12 months after the death of my wife. However I have to remain positive for my daughter and would welcome any advice from parents with children who have bilateral chronic uveitis. My daughter is on steroid eye drops and methatrexate. Any help would be greatly appreciated.,,,,,,,,"I've only just seen this. Glad to hear things are going Ok given the situation. Riley didn't have to have an additional blood test. Only one marker was raised and they weren't going to do anything if it still was, so we decided to leave it.  But am having a difficult week. My good friend passed away on Sunday (not unexpected but hard nonetheless) and then Riley's ""good eye"" went a bit red. Back to eye casulty and he's got cells back in his eye. I was naively hoping that it would all just go away. Not sure what the next step is for us. Back to GOSH tomorrow, I have to say I just feel like crying. It might be methatrexate for us too - but I don't understand the risk of a weaken immune system and the possibility of the chicken pox virus reactivating. So anti-virrals might be thrown into the mix. Can I ask - how is the methatrexate given and how is your daughter managing at school. Poor Riley at the moment can hardly see. Poor eyesight in left eye due to nerve damage from blood clot and poor sight in right as he has been given dilating drops.

I assume the conjunctivitis has been diagnosed and is being treated in the hope that it's controlled rapidly before wandering hands carry the infection to the uveitis eye. I would give the eye clinic a ring - should the uveitis eye become infected, you need to know what to do about the steroid drops. While I would like to think antibiotic drops and steroid drops combined would take care of things, I think this is a situation where only expert advice will do. I would hope that rapid treatment of conjunctivitis in the uveitis eye, should this happen, would prevent a uveitic flare, but can't be sure of this.","So sorry you have this additional worry,",Maxine.,,topic_4426564,uveitis with conjictivitis advice needed please!!,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2014-12-08 12:05:08,Thankyou maxine my hubby is a gp so we are on with treatment its just not what we needed and she has her follow up on wednesday too.

One of the things Diamox does is get rid of unwanted fluid in the body, so it may help with the macular oedema, reducing the retinal build up of fluid.","There are anti vegf injections which work well at getting rid of retinal fluid, but the effect is temporary. For them to have better effect, the inflammation causing the build up of fluid has to be sorted out. I had those injections at one point, but as soon as they wore off, the macular oedema came straight back. Infliximab sorted out both problems for my eyes.",Please keep us updated on how you get on when your specialist returns.,Good luck with the Diamox.,Maxine,"[Last edited Jul 23, 2015 13:57:25]",Not sure when your appointment is this week but if you are able to let us know how your are getting on.,Becca x,"I am wondering why ozurdex is not an option for you if it gets rid of the fluid for a while.  It only lasts a few months so hence keeps coming back so I would have thought that long term this is not a viable plan but as an emergency solution for now until your plan is changed.  I would certainly discuss taking another immunosuppressant which would at least control it if you find the right one.  They take about 3 months to fully kick in so maybe you could have another ozurdex in the interim.  Diamox is usually given to reduce the pressure so I am wondering if you had high pressure too from the steroid drops.  Perhaps another option would be an orbital floor injection (steroids injected to the side of the eye)  similar effect to ozurdex but does not last as long but it may stave things off while you take an immunosuppresant and it has  time to start working.  As Becca said I think it would be a good idea to really go through the options with your specialist so something can  be found to control this.  So many people keep the uveitis controlled with immunosuppressants.  Like you steroids did not agree with me and I feel they are unnecessary long-term but an immunosuppresant or even two maybe your answer.  There is also evidence to show in some people if you take these for a period of time and they work, you may come off them at a later stage and it  kicks your immune system to readjust and behave again.  Finally, as Maxine says  I would most definitely ask your specialist about Humira or infliximab which they will give in Scotland.  I am on Humira and it certainly saved me.  I hope you find a new successful plan which is what you need.  Let us all know how you get on as I know how miserable this can be until you find the right treatment programme.",Tania,"So I was back in yesterday and he said my only options were prednisone or ozurdex. But he strongly advised me against the ozurdex due to my last reaction to it which I understood. So after years of saying I will not go back on prednisone, I am back on it 40mg a day.","Tania, the reason my dr advised me against the ozurdex was becuase during my last one I ended up with a lot of bleeding inside my eye, my retina was pulling and I had the biggest uveitis flate up I had ever had. I thought the implant had came to the front of my eye as sitting at the bottom of the colour of my eye was this cream coloured stuff. Which turned out to be puss from the uveitis flare up, I had to get a steroid injection, an antibiotic injection and sit with a steroid IV in my arm for a while. Was all a little too much for me.",I do however wish I had seen your comment about the other two drugs you mentioned before going to see him. I will keep going with the steroids for 2 weeks until I see him again and then mention these to him.

Then there was no improvement I had pressure in both of my eyes off being on predforte for so long (as it is a steroid drop)so I had to start having cosop eye drops 2 a day to help with that. then there was a slight improvement in my eyes so I went onto cyclopentolate 1% once a day and predforte 0.5% 3 times a day. then I went back and the inflammation came back a bit worse so I had to go back on the cosop eye drops again, and they changed my eyes drops from predforte to lotemax 3 times a day and I stopped the cyclopentolate eye drops. they were working and then they stopped working as effectively so they were literally fighting to save my eye sight. they made the decision to go into hospital for 3 days to have a intravenous methylprednisolone (a steroid drip).

She takes it late Friday night but is nauseous (she takes an antisickness tablet) & wiped out all w/e unable to do anything, no quality of life at all. Also no appetite until maybe Tuesday so losing weight. Her consultant has suggested switching to Mycophenolate tablets daily but I've read this is not so effective as Methotrexate & wont help with her joints (she has suspected arthritis too although still waiting for clear diagnosis of this). We can't decide what to do. Please help. Thanks.",topic_5307412,Methotrexate v's Mycophenolate,,,2016-10-07 07:05:55,"Hi Rachel,","When methotrexate either doesn't work or isn't tolerated for uveitis, mycophenolate is one of the next options and for some patients, it will do the job when mtx failed.","If there were no cells found when you were in Bristol and mtx is now controlling inflammation, then it becomes a question of, 'At what cost to Alice?' At the moment, she's effectively losing half of her week to side effects, which cannot be easy. It's bad enough having uveitis without being poleaxed by treatment! And if there was still significant inflammation, it's even easier - no point suffering if there's no benefit for the eyes.","With the RA suspected, rather than diagnosed, I don't think you have much to lose trying the mycophenolate. If Alice's joints do become unbearable, you can ring the hospital for advice. Could you and Alice perhaps look on it as a break from mtx side effects initially? It takes some time for mtx to leave the body, so if Alice's joints are being helped by it, they shouldn't immediately flare once she stops taking it.",I think life will become much easier once they know exactly what is behind the joint problem. Not getting a clear diagnosis must be so frustrating.,topic_5307412,Methotrexate v's Mycophenolate,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,,"Thank you Maxine. We've been struggling so much to make a decision I've been in tears most days so worried about getting it'wrong' yet not knowing what is 'right'. Our priority of course is doing whatever we can to prevent Alice suffering any sight loss yet feeling the current treatment doesn't allow this to be balanced with her having any quality of life which is also so important. Alice has been so unwell over the past 8 weeks on methotrexate that her mental health is suffering with anxiety prior to the injection & then being very tearful low & despairing after it. Alice doesn't feel she can continue to tolerate being so ill, literally wiped out in bed every w/e as her life has come to a standstill. Her inflammation has improved from 3+ cells to 1+ cells but her pressures have risen to over 30 from the maxidex steroid drops so she is on pressure drops too now. I think all in all you're right & it's going to be best to try mycophenolate & hope this does a better job & that Alice tolerates it significantly better. Having the w/e's back & being able to enjoy life again will make such a difference & help Alice to cope with all that's happening. When Alice was diagnosed we had no idea how complex long drawn out & demoralising treating uveitis could be. & because it's a relatively invisible condition, how isolating it is either.

For example:",Ask why she has been given that diagnosis? Can they explain her blood test results to you? Did she have a false positive result the first time round?,"Your consultant's comment... About the chances of JIA developing, unlikely but possibly sounds familiar. I would bet he / she doesn't know so is covering all bases.

You'll never get a straight yes or no.

Molly also has had 2 cataract ops so if you want to chat let me know.",Hope this helps,Amanda,"Thats great she is on it now on a Friday, I hope it makes a difference.","Molly just turned 10 in March, shes not on ciclosporin. We are back at the hospital next Friday, and it was 6 weeks from our last appt and we are on pred forte 3x day, so I don't know how we'll get on. Her glasses need updated and we are just back from holidays which I think did her the world of good as there were no complaints about any pains in her joints!","I agree with Nicki the mood swings are hard and its hard to know how much is down to their age or the medication, I think its a fine line at least we have some where to rant together now.","Elly started 10 days ago, on 10mg, and has just taken the next dose which was 15mg. The first week, the side effects were weird, hot sweats, fidgety, restless, bad stomach, and exhaustion. This week, some of those side effects have passed, but she is more exhausted than ever, having slept all day, barely being able to open her eyes. Myself, i havent slept for 2 weeks, have felt like i have a huge weight on my shoulders, and have a sick feeling in my stomach. I know it will get easier with time, but i keep on thinking to myself that my daughter is on 'chemo'!!! I am dreading next sunday, when her dose goes up again! The most amazing thing is, is that Elly has not moaned once, she is a true inspiration, and has taken it all in her stride.","At last, my husband has taken his head out of the sand! It only took 3 years, but he realised after seeing Ayliffe, that this really was serious, and the decision we all made for her to go on MTX has not been taken lightly. Although he wont look information up on the internet (unlike me!!) he is now happy to hear me feed him facts about what i have found out, and is firmly committed to getting her better.","I keep on telling Elly this is ""a means to an end"", and this wont be forever, and i know in my heart that we have definitely taken the right step into getting her eye back to some sort of normal vision.","The only other emotion i feel, is a little anger! Why was my daughter not offered MTX a while back?....and why has it taken us as parents, to find someone that will finally tell us the truth, and help us?.....",,,,Keep us informed to how she gets on x,Caron,"Elly is going away, to camp in august for 2 weeks, she is so excited but i am so nervous. She is coming off all meds apart from the dilation drops for the time she is away, and then will go back on then when she comes back. I just hope i can survive the 2 weeks of nerves, and worrying....!","You will find over the coming months that her body increasingly adapts to the mtx, and if she moves on to shots her gastric problems should improve. The mood swings are really hard to deal with, and not knowing how much is the mtx and how much is hormones is also so tricky.  I find the tears easier to handle than the anger which makes me want to bang my head against a wall!","I'm so pleased Elly is able to go away with her friends it's what she needs, and hopefully she'll have 14 days to just be Elly.  I know you'll be a nervous wreck but we're here for you if you need to chat.",Take care,Nicki,,,,"Thanks for your reply....From next week, Elly will be taking her MTX on a friday, so she can recover over a weekend, and be okay to go to school on a monday! She is getting less side effects now, although, does get grumpy at times, and still get cramps in her tummy, and ends up on the toilet quite alot!","She is also on 150mg ciclosporin (did molly take this too?) She is fine on this too, but it is making her slightly hairy all over which is a bit of a worry!","The professor has said he will not operate on her cataract or unstick her pupil from the cornea until she has been a year in remission, so we have a way to go.....maybe in a few years time!","How is your daughter molly now, and how old is she?",Natalie,,Amanda x,"The ciclosporin does cause body and facial hair growth.  We became best friends with Veet and  Joleen in this house which was used everywhere when it got really really bad, but O was on a much higher dose than Elly so hopefully it won't get too severe.

This 'spread' does happen at times and so does fluid on the retina. Fluid on the retina is often doctor speak for the cystoid macular oedema that occurs when inflamation hasn't been controlled. You're also right that this fluid can cause permanent damage, but only if it goes untreated. The steroid injection that you're going to receive has a very good track record of clearing the oedema.","The periocular injection is to the area around the eye, rather than into the eye itself. I've no idea what those feel like, but having had steroid injected elsewhere, I suspect you might feel a short lived stingy pressure as it goes in. The docs are very good at putting you at as much ease as possible before they inject and quite a lot of us who have had injections into the eye itself say the anxiety beforehand was worse than the event. If you're really anxious, the nurse, most likely, will hold your hand.",Usually you can leave the hospital not long after the injection. You might have to wait a while so they can check your ocular pressure before you go though.

The treatments section gives you information about the immunosuppressants.

2011-11-13 18:50:22,"We got the all clear to go ahead with cataract surgery and chelation to the right eye and all was done. The surgery was only suppose to take roughly an hour, yet he was in for almost four! The surgeon remarked that the cataract was suppose to be encapsulated in a clear capsule, but Braiden's was white and rock hard, like concrete. She tried for all that time to chip away at what she could, but was unsuccessful. She fears if she were to progress that she would have torn his retina so she referred us to a retina surgeon to complete the job. She released Braiden from the hospital with no plan for pain. Four hours later, he was screaming! Tylenol and Motrin did nothing! I rushed him to the emergency room where he had IV of Morphine and Zophran, every hour, for 8 hours.

We have just got back from a check up and the good news is that the Humira seems to be working :-) no cells present. However since christmas we have been struggling to get the eye pressure under control and today it was very high at 46! we have been given a couple of different drops today : Trusopt, Timolol and xalatan. And we are back next week at clinic. I am just worried it will get worst not better as it has been going up since Christmas!",topic_1259331,Pressure is 46!,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1004401203/,JacquiKegg,2012-02-08 17:07:59,"Hi Jacqui,",That is high. Is Helena still using steroid drops?,"There are different types of pressure lowering drops and they reduce pressure in different ways: some reduce the fluid produced which raises pressure and some increase the outflow of that fluid. It looks as though the combination of drops you've been given is attacking the problem both ways. Xalatan, in particular, is very effective at reducing pressure.","I hope when you go back next week, Helena's pressures are headed back into the normal range. Were you told to press upper and lower lids together over Helena's tear duct when you put in the drops? When you do that for a minute or so, there is less chance of side effects from those drops.",Great news about the Humira working!

Thanks for the tip regarding pressing lids together after putting eye drops in. And on a positive it is great that she has responded well to the Humira! Long may it continue :-)",Thanks,I think you would have been told if there was permanent damage from the high pressure - doctors can see changes in the optic nerve when they examine eyes.,"Try not to worry too much because the drops work very quickly. Sight can be lost  quickly from high pressure but this is more the case with what they call closed angle glaucoma. If Helena had that, again you would have been told. With open angle high pressure, it generally takes time before damage occurs. I'm all in favour of ringing clinics when you're worried - reassurance from doctors sets a mind at rest.","Know what you mean about describing to others what is strange about sight - even harder when you're only six! If Helena has just started saying her eyes feel strange, it may be that her sight is blurring for a bit after the glaucoma drops go in. Some of those drops also make eyes feel a bit uncomfortable. Does Helena say the strangeness is all the time or does it come and go? It's worth mentioning when you ring the clinic today - they might have an explanation for it that has nothing to do with drops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Hope you get some explanations - and enough peace of mind to keep you going until next week.,Maxine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The only thing that was unusual to him was the fact that Helena has no inflamation in her eyes at the moment.

When the inflammation is confined to the eyes, treatment varies according to the part of the eye affected, the severity of inflammation, how often the attacks occur and whether one or both eyes are affected. When the inflammation is present elsewhere in the body as well as the eyes, it's sometimes necessary to treat the immune system as a whole.","The side effects of steroid drops affect the eyes - cataracts will form and some people find the steroid raises their eye pressure. When the immune system as a whole is treated with oral, injectible drugs or iv drugs, the potential side effects may cause damage to the rest of the body, as well as lowering the body's defences. Doctors balance potential benefit with risk before starting patients on immunosuppressant treatment.","If your attacks are becoming more frequent, you could initiate a discussion about whether immunosuppression treatment would be of more benefit than risk for you. You'll find details about the commonly used treatments in the treatments section.",You can always ask to see the consultant in the clinic.

In some cases one injection might be enough but repeated injections are not uncommon. I don't know how many it's safe to have.,"When people with uveitis have cataract surgery, they may receive either a short course of high dose oral steroid or a pulse of iv steroid just before the op. This is done to give the best chance of eliminating the possibility of post op flare. Since you already have the steroid in your eye from the Ozdurex implant, it will be protecting your eye from inflammation and hopefully CME caused by inflammation.

As you may have guessed I was told I had uveitis (which I suspect to be of the posterior variety). There has been no investigation as to what has caused the uveitis, as I am generally of good health. To cut a long story short the upshot of the diagnosis to date has been: Oral steroids, Fluorescein Angiogram, Kenalog injections x 2, Laser, Vitrectomy and ERM peel, numerous eye drops and Ozurdex implants x 2 (which I can't have without a GA after a bad experience with the Kenalog injection - maybe I'm just a wimp!) and I am now waiting for a cataract operation (Dec). Oh and I still have some small haemorrhages periphally that havent been explained as yet.","As additional background I have also had - in the same eye, laser for retinal tears, scheral buckle for a detachment and a haemorrhage (a few years prior to the retinal detachment) about 12 years ago, I also have a high myopia! As you would expect the vision was not very good before this latest set of problems - about 4/5 lines on the chart, but I haven't seen even the first line for a while!",I'd also ask your surgeon if you will be able to have further Ozdurex implants after the cataract surgery if your eye needs more.,"Good luck with the cataract surgery. I couldn't even see the chart before mine so it was brilliant the morning after to see the chart and even better, the world again!","Take care,",Maxine,"Sorry to go on and on especially when I know that there are people in a much worse position than I am, it just extremely frustrating. I am so glad to hear that your cataract operation helped :) and whilst I dread the operation (I have a bit of a phobia about them now) at least once its done I will be able to be aware of the Uveitis/CME which I cant at the moment because of the cataract (if that makes sense).",Thank you again,"I'm so sorry to read about your experiences, you've really been through the mill. Which hospital are you treated at?",Best Wishes,Nicki,,Sorry to read your eye pressure has gone up.,"Thanks for the reply, funnily enough I have been today and pressure down to 19 :) so the Timolol is working. I mentioned the rash and apparently the drops dont give you a rash! Advice was to 'go and see your GP'! (Yes I do the finger in the corner thing) The rash looks a little like psoriasis (from pictures I've seen and which I have never suffered with before) and as no-one has yet investigated what caused the uveitis/macular edema I am going to try to get a GP appt and get blood tests done etc. to try and rule things out if nothing else. However in my experience Drs can be a bit funny if they think you are trying to self diagnose lol",Best wishes,Lyn,,,,"From what I understand my current problems are not due to the uveitis but to cystoid macular oedema, which returns once the steroid wears off (about 3 weeks after the Kenalog and about 12 weeks after the Ozurdex).",Has anyone had anything similar?  Could I still have uveitis? How many Ozurdex implants can you have? Is it possible that the cataract operation will make the macular oedema worse even with the Ozurdex implant in place?,I am now finding the whole thing very tiring and am beginning to despair. Any help or information that anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.,Many thanks,,,,,,,I got all sorts of side effects from various glaucoma drops. Iopidine gave me a rash. Don't think it's in the same class of glaucoma drops as Timolol though. Have you tried blocking your tear duct with a finger for a minute or so after the drop goes in? Doing this is supposed to reduce the chance of side effects since less of the drug gets into the blood stream.,Glaucoma drops come in a number of different types. Your ophth. can probably change the drop if the rash doesn't go or you can't stand it staying.,Maxine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lyn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lyn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2013-08-30 10:58:24,"Hello, I am hoping you can please offer me some advice. My daughter who is 3 was diagnosed with JIA on 1st August and within minutes of the rheumatologist diagnosing her she saw the ophthalmologist who said she had active anterior uveitis in both eyes. My husband and I were shocked. She was immediately put onto Pred Forte 1% eye drops 3 times a day and preparations were made for her to begin methotrexate treatment. She had a check up yesterday and we were told her uvetitis is under control and she was to reduce her eye drops to twice a day and they would reassess in 4 weeks. Whilst I am delighted at the outcome of this appointment I still feel there is a cloud hanging over us and now don't understand some things. Is it possible the uveitis can go away completely or will it only go into remission for some time? We have been told the eye drops are only for short/mid term use due to the potential problems they can cause so if the inflammation increases then methotrexate will begin. Is it possible that because she has no active joint inflammation with her JIA that the uveitis has also gone? Does it ever disappear for good or will she have this so long as she has JIA? Thank you in advance for any help you can offer. I just feel like there is so much to take on board. The ophthalmologist said her Uveitis is only under control because of the eye drops which I thought was a great thing but he was still serious in his manner and I didn't get a chance to ask my questions.

2016-03-29 15:40:03,"hi there everyone, im Jemma, son to Owen who will be 13 in may, he was diagnosed with uveitis  in sept 2014, (the week he stared his new school, only managed the 1st day) that first flare up was the first time i had ever heard of it, he saw a consultant for nine months every month, having drops. could find cause, no joint pain etc, no further flare up so was discharged. Nearly a year to the day he got it again, but in the other eye, and within a week it was in both eyes, back on the drops, and atropine aswell, had three weeks off school, twice a week vists to the eye clinic, nearly started charging me rent lol. all cleared and was doing great. Had a scheduled appointment to see rhumatologist to start teking methortrexate, but a few days before he had stared violently vomiting, i thought it was a bug, but she was concerend that it might be eye pressure, so back to eye clinic, saw his consultant who admitted him straight away, something to do with aggravated uveitis and swollen optice nerevs. He was given intravenous steroids for three days, he was in no pain, not light sensitive, no red eyes, how can i get him treated when he shows no symptoms.He has now been on methortrexate for a month, gets fortnightly blood tests, then next month goes to montly. I he is hla b27+ which i didnt know about from his first ever blood tests, but keep getting told that its nothing to worry about, but when you look it up its his immune system is not good. Feel like im being kept out the loop and other times not, ive never heard of another child having it, Owen im sure would love to talk to someone who has it. sorry for the rambling but so glad i found your site. any help or advice would be most welcome. Im in Hull, yorkshire if anyone local is on here. many thanks, Jemma",topic_5198882,hi there,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10206274351838711/,JemmaHoward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2015-01-13 23:05:23,Unfortunately my original thread seems to have disappeared but I felt an update was due (there's some history here -,topic_4496093,Son's Intermediate Uveitis,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/100001520958527/,PeteM,2015-01-14 08:53:39,Thanks for that update Pete.,Regarding long term side effects of steroids. Riley's original consultant was very much of the opinion that long term side effects were unlikely and they could be managed. I have to say I find him equally frustrating and reassuring. I just 'love' his reassuring manner as an 'anxious' parent; - I love my worries being soothed.,"We went back to his him recently and it was a good appointment. One cell in each eye, not quite zero but nearly. He  also said that Riley's cataract (was very minor) and might never cause a problem. All fantastic. We agreed to stay in the loop with him. I don't want to burn bridges completely but we formally moved Riley's care. I will always be eternally grateful for him for not messing around and getting Riley admitted ASAP to hospital. However, there is a BUT to this....","Given Riley's (fingers crossed) tolerance to MTX. Seemingly no / minor side effects and so far, blood test results holding steady. I wish we had started MTX last April. I really like the reassurance don't get me wrong but I now have a double knot at the bottom of my stomach. I know Riley's original Consultant is right and not right all at the same time. I had been lead to believe (rightly or wrongly) that we would have ages before we had to start playing the steroid vs cataract route and yes, his cataract might have been caused by uveitis but still......... Also, the cataract diagnosis was just one more hit I could have done with out. It is funny but it is the one thing that has caused me the most problems because I knew he could get cataracts from steroids. I had read the information and yet I didn't act fast enough to stop it from happening. At this moment in time, I would choose MTX over cataract or glaucoma surgery every time.",Pete your son's case is (I think on the face of it - if you don't mind me saying) less complicated; Riley's uveitis could have been caused by VZV - so I still find the compromised immune system thing a wee bit terrifying. But you take your chances and play the odds but so far (fingers crossed) - MTX has been fine.,topic_4496093,Son's Intermediate Uveitis,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/100006853813281/,RebeccaSalter,2015-01-14 12:08:48,"Hi Becca, thankfully (at present) I think my sons case is less complex and milder (particularly as its only in one eye at present - touch wood). Also, being intermediate, he suffers none of the discomfort that anterior Uveitis sufferers experience. These factors do make the argument for MTX perhaps a little weaker.","Despite the above, instinctively, a life time of Ozurdex steroid implants feels rather hazardous (not to mention expensive!) to me. If the Uveitis does come back then I will definitely seek another consultation with Prof Ayliffe and / or Prof Dicks to get a more informed decision regarding Ozurdez or MTX.",Best wishes for Riley and yourself.,topic_4496093,Son's Intermediate Uveitis,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/100001520958527/,PeteM,2015-03-30 21:12:33,"Just a quick update.

Right this moment I am quietly dissolving inside waiting for Riley to be seen at Bristol. I so want this to be over but just know there will be more downs than ups. Personally, I wouldn't wait to long before facing immune suppressants - seemingly you go go from no steroid related problems in one appointment to being told that a cataract is starting in the next one. Then you are faced with cataract and immunosuppressants.

They are hoping the injection might be more effective but only by 10% which doesn't sound good odds to me. They did sound confident though that if his eyes didn't improve they would apply for funding for HUMIRA - it is just the taurma of getting it in to him. I just worry about the steroids on his cataract / mittendorf dot.... I am tired. I think I just like to go for HUMIRA really and stop phaffing about. Riley has been taking MTX for 6 months now.

About a month ago my son had some tests for optic nerve damage on his bad eye. This was followed up with an appointment with his consultant. I'm pleased to report that his Uveitis doesn't appear to have come back and the bad eye is now looking completely normal (apart from a single floater). There was no optic nerve damage and in time gravity may drop the floater out of his line of sight. His eye sight in the bad eye is still poor but this may be unrelated (he's having more tests to get to the bottom of this).,"So, it would appear that the Uveitis episode was a one off. Touch wood and fingers crossed this is the case.",He's also got a new girl friend and new job and is happier than he has been for years.,I dearly wish you eventually have similar good outcomes for yourselves and your kids.,Thinking of you all.,"Best wishes, Pete",,topic_4496093,Son's Intermediate Uveitis,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/100001520958527/,PeteM,2016-02-15 13:46:16,"Thanks for the update, Pete, and good to know your son escaped optic nerve damage. That's a worry with some types of uveitis and for steroid responders.",topic_4496093,Son's Intermediate Uveitis,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,http://askcsf.yuku.com/topic/2900/Intermediate-Uveitis-Treatment-Inflammation-gone-blurred#.VLWexdKsWXZ,).,"You are also right (not that it applies to Riley). You can have the odd drink on MTX as long as your liver enzymes hold steady. I think it is like drinking in pregnancy better not too because there is no one safe level for all, but the odd tipple.....","Thanks also about the glasses info. I had booked Riley in for the optician but cancelled.  I have a debate going on in my head. His improvement in his sight with the pinhole is one line. Good eye with cataract still slightly better than 20/20. His bad eye is about 0.53 on the log MAR scale which I think (don't like all these different terms) is between 6/19 and 6/24. If anything his sight had improved slightly at his last appointment being between 6/19 and 6/24 without the pinhole. Normally, it is 6/24 with pinhole. Are you confused? I am! Prehaps I should campaign for all hospitals to use the same standardisation of visual acuity.","I am being very honest when I say I would find the absolute realisation that his bad eye is never going to anything near normal vision even with glasses upsetting (though I know that it is the case). I guess I'm not ready for that yet. Also as he is only 7, I think the hassle of glasses for one line in one eye might not be worth the aggravation. We will re visit the glasses idea in a couple of months time.","Riley is now on one steroid eye drops every other day, in each eye and 15mg/week of MTX. He and his brother have had a nasty cold, taken a while to shift but if anything his brother appeared the worst off. Sssssh their Dad had to take to bed - with his bout!",,,"In the mean time, life goes on!",Best wishes to you all.,,The consultant has recommended a second Ozurdex injection (first one was last summer). This will be done immediately under the NHS (consultant warned though that funding for Ozurdex for NHS might be removed within the next few months). He is still reluctant to go down the Immunosuppressive as it's just in the one eye and there's no sign of cataracts or other side effects yet. The vision in the bad eye is pretty knackered now. Consultant does hope that the Uveitis might burn itself out eventually as my son gets older. He's also ordered a couple more tests including cat scratch.,Maxine,,,,Sorry for hijacking your post Pete. I do think Bristol is the best place to go if Ayliffe and rh cost of prescription drugs become prohibitive.,Becca x,,In November we arranged a private appointment with Prof Ayliffe to get a second opinion. He suggested my son have some additional tests:,Weils (son confessed to swimming in a local lake that is know to have rats!),HLAB-27,Lyme's,,,,I think we'll go ahead with the Ozurdex and use the time it buys us to get second opinions from either Mr Dick or Prof Ayliffe (I've asked for the consultant to email the scans to me) and consider other options.,Best wishes to you all.,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,I can't believe its been 5 months since my last post. In the end we went with the second Ozurdex injection. This was partly due to my son having some emotional / anxiety issues and we didn't feel it was right to go down the immunosuppressant route at that time. I had a brief email exchange with Prof Ayliffe who thought this was a reasonable course of action and my sons' consultant ophthalmologist recommended this course of action bearing in mind the Uveitis had responded well to this treatment and was only in one eye.,My son's mental state further deteriorated further and soon after leaving college he developed very severe OCD. As a result he became virtually housebound and was spending hours checking doors and sterilizing everything he touched. Following some sessions with a psychiatrist and psychologist and lots of anti depressants he's overcome this and is pretty much back to normal now. Thankfully our health insurance met the bill otherwise I suspect he's still be suffering / waiting for the NHS.,Thanks for the update and congratulations to your son on doing so well at college despite uveitis.,"It was distressing reading about his mental health and thank goodness you were able to access help rapidly and he's more or less back to his old self. Uveitis sufferers should be supported sufficiently that they don't get into this state, but it happens to far too many of us, especially those who suffer sight loss. A few NHS Centres do provide psychological support and we hope this will be extended to more. Can't happen soon enough.",I was of course aware of Ozurdex but hadn't heard of Sirolimus so will do some of my own research and discuss this with his consultant when we next see him. Having Ozurdex available in the NHS could be a god send to us.,"Regards, Pete",,,,So like all of us who use this site. Just hoping for the best really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On the positive side, despite all his health issues he got top marks for his college course and has even found himself a very sweet girlfriend.","Regarding the Uveitis, today he had a follow-up appointment and both eyes are clear. Who knows if it will return but we'll take things as they come. We might even manage to get a holiday in before the end of the year!",We're still waiting for the results.,"He said that the treatment my son has had was pretty good and the permanent damage to my sons one bad eye is fairly minor (even his bad eye, with some correction, would be good enough for driving).",,,,,,Pete,,,,As a result of the above we cancelled our appointment with Prof Dick in Bristol (need to save this referral for a later date if required).,"We then had a follow up with my sons normal consultant ophthalmologist and discussed potential treatments with him (if the Uveitis returns) (my sons Ozurdex injection has a few months remaining). We discussed the Ayliffe appointment and I asked about Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. Methotrexate) but his view is that whilst the Uveitis is in just one eye and is responding well to Ozurdez that this is the best long term treatment. He is confident that any side effects (which I suppose means cataracts) can be 'managed'. Whilst I can see his point, after everything I've read, I'm still not convinced steroids are the way to continue. We will discuss this further with Prof Ayliffe if / when the time comes. Interesting our ophthalmologist wasn't aware of the link to Weil's or Lyme's. he was aware of the link with HLAB-27 but said that a positive diagnosis of this is of little help.","Becca, if you recall we discussed whether glasses would help vision damaged by Uveitis. When my son was with Prof Aylifee he had a pinhole eyetest. With this, my son could clearly see the bottom line of the chart. My son went to see an optician last week and it turns out that glasses would aid his vision so we're going to give that a go (more expense!).","So in summary, we're in an OK place at the moment and if we're lucky the Uveitis won't reoccur. If we're really lucky we might get to the bottom of the original cause and fix that too.",Best wishes and good luck to everyone else too.,Best Becca x,"[Last edited Jan 14, 2015 10:03:21]",Best wishes to you all.,Pete,"OV attended a NICE scoping workshop in the summer which looked at the use of Ozurdex and sirolimus in the eye. Both are now being considered by NICE as additions to uveitis treatments and, if successfully approved, should remove funding issues. Sirolimus has been shown useful in mild intermediate uveitis and spares the patient the potential side effects of immune suppressants. However, have no idea whether your son's uveitis would be considered suitable for such a treatment if it becomes routinely available.",Hope you do fit in that holiday.,Maxine,"[Last edited Oct 10, 2015 13:33:21]",Fingers also crossed here that the uveitis was a one off.,All the best with the further testing to determine the cause of the lost sight in the bad eye and for your son's future.

I hope that your eyesight continues to improve.,"I was diagnosised with bilateral intermediate uveitis in May, with some macular odema which was creating a blind spot. I was started on steroid and for a while everything was going swimmingly. Alas the tapering off of the steroids has been less successful, with me having to present at eye casulty last week as the blind spot was starting again. I can completley relate to the emotional rollercoaster - to the point where I am having to have some time off work to deal with the whole situation more productivly than I have been by not admitting I am scared.","Thanks for your post, take care, Donna",,topic_1941153,Hi from a newbie !,http://www.facebook.com/donna.smith.5,DonnaWiththeniceshoesSmith,,Hi Donna,"Yes I can completely relate to your experience as I went for a regular check up at the hospital a couple of days ago and was told I now have macular oedema in one eye which they said was perfectly treatable, but it's still scary isn't it ? I found there is very little in the way of 'Emotional support' services available especially during the early days of having uveitis (so just at the point where I feel folks need support the most so websites such as this are great ). I put pressure on myself by constantly putting on a brave face and saying I felt fine when I actually felt really scared and frightened. There came a point where I realised tat I needed to do something and I contacted the RNIB who have been absolutely fantastic and  although I felt I wasn't the sort of person who needed any 'counselling' , I have found it so helpful just talking to someone on the phone  for a short while every couple of weeks and they also helped me with finding out more about uveitis - as I felt that I hardly knew anything about the disease. I have been off work for quite a while - a good few months - but hope to make a gradual return to work in a month or twos time. I guess what I've learnt on this long road is that taking things a Day at a time is the key but it is so frustrating sometimes - but we will get there !

It ranges from folks thinking I just have a bit of mild blurry vision (if only !) to close friends knowing that it is a really challenging condition.  Like Donna, my consultant is also fantastic so that helps a lot and he is very honest in terms of explaining which symptoms are more serious than others ( ie which symptoms we need to worry about and what We don't need to worry about). However saying that, I didn't even know what terms such as 'flare' meant until last week when I read the glossary on this website so that has also been really helpful.

I have been being treated for uveitis with retinal detachments for the past eight months and after reading Anons story on your weboages my story has many similarities. After lots of surgery my sight is now returning after what has been a very scary period and there is still a long way to go but the immuno and steroid treatment is working well and I've now been on that for 5 months. It's great to find a forum like this just to read about other peoples experiences as the most difficult part of all if this has been the emotional roller ouster and not feeling like 'me' sometimes. Just wanted to say that I've been having some informal counselling from the RNIB which really helped as at one point I was in the legally blind category earlier in the year. The thing I have realised with uveitis is that the additional symptoms and complications such as cloudy /dim vision can cause as many problems as the pure loss of acuity but I've found this site invaluable around providing more info on this. I am making good progress and can start to do things like reading and venturing out and about on my own into town again which is great after nearly a whole year of significant sight loss . Anyway just saying hello and hope you are all well !,,,,,,,,"I totally agree with the emotional support thing, think it is especially frustrating when people haven't even heard of uveitis. I have been similar with the brave face - joking about the severity actually not appreciating or embracing the fact that I am frightened and I don't like the fact I have little control over what is going to happen and that despite lots of tests I have not presented with any other possible underlying causes.","Think my main problem of avoidance has been when I have flashes of panic, like when I couldn,t see my toenails to paint them, or when I can't tell the difference between navy and black - but then I develop a strategy of making it fit without allowing others to help.","I have made the first step today by going to the doctors and being honest, he has recommended some time off work - I work in mental health, so obvious I am not able to concentrate on others needs without addressing my own. I have also made a self referral to a councilling service through work and had a telephone session this morning.","I completly understand the feeling fit and well thing - that makes it slightly more frustrating sometimes, especially the look on the consultants face when he asks about various symptoms I may have and me replying no to everyone!

2017-08-06 15:32:54,"I was diagnosed with Anterior Uveitis which I had never heard of till then on 2 May 2017 after 5 weeks of treatment with Pred Forte drops on a reducing basis, Maxitol ointment at night and Mydrilate drops 2 times per day I was told to stop medication when drops had been reduced to 2 times per day for 7 days which I did. My review appointment was not till the following week. 4 days later my eye had flared up again and I had to phone clinic for appointment. Unknown to myself my pupil had been stuck to the lens in 2 places at my original appointment. I was put back on hourly drops for 5 days reducing to 6 x per day and 4 x per day however my eye got worse and pupil stuck again. After various toibg and firing to eye clinic and various attempts to unstick the lens i was sent home with the pupil still 3/4 stuck and mydrilate and more Pred Forte drops. Needless to say at my next review a week later my eue had got worse and pupil almost fully stuck. I was then given an injection to release pupil which eorked and back on Pred Forte hourly with Atropine drops 2 x per day. At next review a week later Atropibe was stopped and Pred zforte reduced to 6x per day for 1 week and 4x per day for 1 week. Had to go back to casualty eye clinic a week later as eye getting redder and pupil not dilating. I have since attended eye clinic 2 more times with Pred Forte drops being reduced and have been on Atropine 2 x per day for 2 weeks with no sign of pupil dating any further. Doctor didn't seem to think there was anything stronger they could give me to help. I am getting really upset as don't seem to be getting any further forward although inflammation seems to have subsided a little. The doctor seems to think that this is linked to my Seronegative inflammatory arthritis which I have had for a number of years and have taken Sulphasalasine for the last 4 years. I haven't been tested for anything else.

The pupil getting stuck happens to quite a few people and the degree to which it affects vision, depends on the position it sticks in. With the pupil controlling the amount of light which enters the eye, your vision may be affected in different light conditions so, for example, people whose pupils stick fully in a dilated position may need sunglasses in very bright light. One of mine was partially stuck and it needed a dilating drop (a weaker one than yours) every day until it was unstuck as part of cataract surgery a couple of years later. It didn't significantly affect my sight, possibly because the pupil was never fully dilated nor fully constricted.","Have you had an appointment with your rheumatologist since uveitis started to discuss it?

Have felt very alone with this till now as nobody else I have spoken to have even heard of this. The eye clinic at the hospital I attend are not very forthcoming with information and details of my condition. I have had to find info from the internet and ask them what things mean. I think at last appointment my pupil is approximately 2/3 stuck to the lens but was told no point in continuing Atropine as didn't appear to be working and that is the strongest they can give me. Feel as though they have just given up and will only now do something if eye pressure rises too high and that will be a lasered  hole in the iris. As far as Rheumatologist is concerned I have actually asked my GP 3 weeks ago to contact him to ask if he can review my medication etc as 2 of my joints are still swollen since the onset of the recurrence of the Uveitis. As far as uveitis specialists are concerned I have tried to research if there are any in the area where I live - Ayrshire in SW Scotland but there doesn't seem to be any. Think the closest I can find is Aberdeen. I feel the more I learn the condition then I will be aware of what my eye should look and feel like to know when something isn't right as I don't seem to get much support at the eye clinic without knowing what questions to ask. I have mentioned to the doctor that i can see a fluid in my eye almost like looking through an oily liquid with a few little black strands in it but there was no comment on whether this is normal for my condition or not so none the wiser. Although there is info on the net sometimes it is hard to know what is relevant. There is no support groups locally to me as far as I can find so relieved when I found this site.

The eye needed a thing called a scleral buckle because in my case, the traction had affected the retina. From what I understand, in some cases, the traction can resolve by itself.","The surgery itself was done under general anaesthetic and post op, one dose of painkillers was enough for discomfort.

Not easy - everything about uveitis worries me.",Your reading on the web may have led you to discovery of a new method of treating the traction with an injected drug - microplasmin.

If you know of an underlying cause for your son's uveitis which is related to a genetic element, the chances of two children developing uveitis are possibly a little higher.

Maxine is right the genetics is very complicated (and it is best to speak to your consultant), however as a rule of thumb (and I remind you that I am NOT MEDICAllY TRAINED) there are some genetic conditions that run in families that can pre-dispose you to getting uveitis. However, generally you would expect them to crop up somewhere else in the family.

The two can also be used in combination, there can be all sorts of different combination of drugs that can be used.  Different hospitals have different criteria for using treatments or combinations of drugs or altogether different treatments. My son is given folic acid in liquid form (he is 7) so we just squirt it into his mouth, so there are alternatives to pills. The prescribing hospital just asked our GP to prescribe it, so don't think it is particularly unusal or expensive. Believe me my GP surgery would have told me. They had to do a cost benefit analysis before agreeing to prescribe oral methotrexate. The folic acid is called ""Lexpec"" and he has it in a 2.5mg/5ml Oral solution. There is also anti-sickness medication that can be prescribed. My son received excellent care at GOSH but we decided to more him to a tertiary research centre where there treatment philosophy is just different. But I should add we are still under the periodic care of GOSH.","We saw my son's rheumatologist privately today for my younger son, though we have","requested a referral on the NHS, my nerves couldn't take the strain. Don't panic yet about your daughter I have had several discussions with specialist nurses and they told me that they rarely see siblings both presenting with JIA. Indeed, they said it would be very unusal. Take heart also if there have been no swollen joints.",One step at a time.... eyes first.... If you are really worried you could request a blood test for auto immune and inflammation markers. Given your daughters complaints and son diagnoses JIA it doesn't seem unreasonable. I just know how horrible blood tests are for little ones but it might help determine if anything 'unusal' is going on.,topic_4549483,does uveitis run in families?,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/100006853813281/,RebeccaSalter,2015-02-07 22:01:33,We also had the cataracts then both lenses removed then steroid injections then cells removed in both eyes. It's all fun!!!!! The folic acid liquid is well worth asking for to see if it makes a difference. He feels rotten for at least 24 hours after methotrexate and he hates the injections so it always makes me feel guilty for doing it.

A couple of weeks ago something did not feel right so I went to the walk in clinic at St Pauls (I wish I had known you could do that from day one!) and they checked, there was still cells in both eye, and scan showed that the stars have decreased again; the doctor said that she would not treat the inflammation as she has worked closely with the uveitis client and they will want to see if and how they develop.. I then received a letter from the Uveitis Clinic pushing my appointment back six weeks so I assume they were also happy with the scan..","Detecting uveitis early is important for u because posterior inflammation is damaging.

The scan would have shown what is going on at the back of the eye.

With uveitis in one eye and episcleritis in the other, he is the best person to say whether your right eye is likely to escape uveitis.","Cataracts and steroid tend to go together but uveitis itself can also cause them. Cataract surgery cures cataract, but not uveitis. It's a shock to hear you have early signs of cataract but it can take a long time before a cataract affects vision with some uveitis patients seeing well for years before they need surgery. It's important that once vision is affected you tell Prof A how it's affected because we may see the eye chart well in a darkened room, but in natural light and artificial light, we don't see so well.  Specialists usually operate at the point everyday life is affected and the eye has been free of inflammation for three months. Prof A will schedule surgery as soon as you need it.","Glaucoma is a risk in uveitis but specialists are incredibly careful to prevent people developing it. High eye pressure, which often precedes glaucoma, can be reduced by drops and sometimes surgery to prevent glaucoma.

Her knee has never flared up since starting the methotrexate but her eyes would always flare up once the eye drops were stopped.  Her eyes have recently flared while still taking the eye drops so her methotrexate was increased.

He finally told the rheumy he couldn't stand it anymore and wanted to try ""something else"". The rheumy explained infusions. Braiden has had tons of IV's previous to this so the process was familiar. He told the rheumy, ""I've had IV's before. They're not bad at all. Let's do that"". That was the sealer on the deal.

Also as she is back on eye drops twice a day it will be 6 months before we are able to wean completely off the drops then another two month before her next check up to fully know if her eyes are still clear so I am concerned that I could be giving my daughter a very painful injection for eight months to find out its possibly not working and have to increase it then maybe go onto the infusions anyway.,This is proving such a difficult choice to make. Humira would be very convenient as it can be done at home along with the methotrexate but I know my daughter would prefer the infusions.,What are everybody else's experiences with these drugs?  I understand that these drugs work differently for everyone and that this needs to be my decision but it would be great to find out what other people are going through and what has worked for them.,Many thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fiona,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2013-03-17 20:20:24,Hi everyone.  Not been on the site for sometime.  Harrison was diagnosed with idiopathic bilateral uveitis when he was 3 and he is now almost 6.  He developed steroid induced cateracts in both eyes but the one in his left is now so bad and his sight deteriorating that they are wanting to operate very soon.  Has anyone had a child who has been through this?  I know cateract surgery is very different in children so any useful info would be great and especially any questions I need to ask the consultant.  Harrison just had a flare and it responded to Vexol and his pressures are now down from 33 to 8.  He seems to be very steroid responsive so the Maxidex that he has been mainly on for over 2 years are probably responsible for the cateract and pressure issues.  He is extremely photophobic but has fantastic glasses now which are photochromic so that helps.  Any info and advice would help.

Matthew has painful Humira injections and developed a severe phobia and fought us every way he could when it was time for his medication.

In desperation I searched the internet for anything to help him be in control and manage his meds. This is when I happened across Buzzy a distraction, cold vibrating device which works by confusing pain signals. I'd try anything at the time and was doubtful it would work but made a big fuss about him with Matthew in the hope it may work. Well from the very first time he was used he was amazing! Matthew didn't feel a thing and since then hasn't. He's become another family member and Matthew is in control throughout any needle procedures now!  I can't rate this product enough and now hospitals are looking at the item to help all children receiving procedures.  Matthew still has Emla cream and Lidocaine mixed with Humira (they didn't work on their own) We haven't yet dropped either as it works for him and we are a bit reluctant to knock his confidence as yet as Buzzy has given him the control and the pain free injection.

2013-03-10 08:58:23,"Hi Just feeling desperate and wanted some words of wisdom somewhere.  Two years of uveitis, one eye only, never been off steroid drops as always active, had two orbital floor injections in this time, pressure suddenly soared one day to 55 but back down to 14 with two different drops (which i think aggravate the Uveitis) so have now accepted I have to go on Methotrexate which I never wanted to as only have one eye effected.  Been taking it for 3 weeks now.  I am now feeling desperate, I see hardly anything out of my bad eye (cant read anything} just all a blur and although I have one good eye everything is off balance with one side a blurr.  I have sub capsular cataract but just cannot believe that in the space of one year which is when it was first spotted I have gone from seeing to a complete blur and now finding it hard to work properly as glasses make no difference, live alone with my teenager so work is crucial.  I cannot have op as my Uveitis is never quiet and now I am convinced I have swelling at the back of eye again although they said they don't think so  but that it is hard to see through the cataract. Is it possible that just the cataract could make vision so bad in such a short space of time, 4 months ago I could see letters still if i put glasses on.  All the things I love doing have now gone out the window, is it like this for everyone or am I just not being positive enough?  :(",topic_2474071,Cataract blindness,https://www.facebook.com/tatiana.wade.1,TatianaWade,2013-03-10 16:56:12,"Hi Tatiana,",Sorry it's all feeling too much right now.,"It can take some time for the brain to adapt to the different sight from each eye, but it does adapt and eventually you stop feeling so conscious of the blur on one side. It's a pain waiting for this to happen though - took me at least two months and even then, I could still upset myself by shutting the better eye and mourning, all over again, what had been lost.","Sometimes cataracts develop for several years before they affect sight and if steroid sparing treatment begins, the interval between first sighting and surgery can be lengthy. For a few people, they develop rapidly and some glaucoma drops accelerate their development as do steroid injections. My own cataracts developed very slowly for eighteen months, then it was a matter of only two months before the world was a blur.","Good for you making the move to mtx. You've spared yourself the danger from the steroid induced high pressure and once the mtx controls inflammation, you're in a much better position for cataract surgery with an immunosuppressant in place to help with the possibility of post op. inflammation.",topic_2474071,Cataract blindness,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2013-03-12 21:19:23,"Thank you Ellie, gosh that must have been so scary everything going completely black, makes my blur seem less bad.

Went back to Moorfields city, begging them to take me back, so back under Mr P  They did OCT scan and confirmed the oedema.  Also said they didn't think Orbital floor would work, although once before it did when I was told it wouldn't.  I am frightened of Ozurdex after reading everything plus my insurance won't cover as changed my policy (huge mistake) and now have to wait 2 years to get cover!  Was told NHS takes forever to agree it so its out anyway.  Interestingly i asked about anti vegf as had been offered to go on trial a while back but got scared and then orbial floor worked at that time anyway.  Would pay if it is a good option but not sure what it is but had an idea it can make pressure go up too?","Ended up leaving Moorfields casualty today with boxes of steroids. One thing that bothers me re the oral steroids from what I have been reading is that they can still give you cataract.  This really bothers me as one eye is good and not harmed so would hate to compromise this otherwise then I really won't be able to see.  What do you think, currently have 4 unopened boxes that I am frightened to start  swallowing?  Am really interested to find out now quickly if the anti vegf is an option for me?

Don't think one course is going to place your other eye at much risk of cataract blindness.,"It's the morning and still staring at pills plucking up courage, seems so dramatic 12 pills every day!  Having read what you said I realise that even if I get on trial then I need inflammation gone anyway (vaguely remember her saying this last time now)   I think  things only kept at bay when orbital floor wore off last time as I was always on so much maxidex until this time when new hospital took me off it hence the oedema again.  Maybe the Mxt will kick in soon after short course of steroids......gosh I am driving myself crazy trying to get courage Tx",Sorry for being slow to reply.,"No, I'm not on immunosuppressants, never have been, because it's nearly always been one eye only, and they tend not to go down that road with it.  As for my uveitis history, it was active from 12 to 18, and then flared up a little at 21. It's been quiet from then until recently, aged 34, when it suddenly came back, but as anterior this time (always intermediate when I was a teenager). I've also had an epiretinal membrane peeled off as they thought it was posing a risk to the retina.","I sort of hope you've given the steroids a try by now, as I'm worrying about your sight. If all else fails, a chat with your GP might help - s/he will have seen many people take steroids for many different things, and can perhaps help with a different perspective.   E x",,,,,,,,,,,"With the anti vegf, pressure may rise, but they can compensate by letting down the pressure just before the injection. It's done with a needle - odd sensation, bit uncomfortable but not painful. The pressure rises again naturally over the next few hours. You do have to be aware that improvement doesn't last months like it can do with steroid injections and the underlying cause of the oedema isn't changed. I think there is a Lucentis trial going on at Moorfields for recalcitrant cystoid macular oedema, but I think you have to be inflammation free. By the way, if you can get on that trial, if you can cope with orbital floor injections, the anti vegf into the eye will feel like a piece of cake in comparison!",Have you taken that first pill yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you do go for the steroid tablets, make sure your GP/consultant does the correct checks - I'm not sure of the full list, but I think blood pressure and some blood tests every so often.",,,"Also, you mention worrying about the cataract.

Confidentiality will be respected, and anonymity can be retained.",topic_606070,Does your child suffer from JIA associated uveitis?,,,2011-06-12 05:51:09,"Hello,","My daughter, who is also named Olivia, was dxed with pauciarticular JIA at 16 months. Her joints were txed with cortisone injections at 20 months and have remained ""quiet"" ever since. She was dxed with uveitis at 23 months and was treated with Predforte drops for one year until she developped glaucoma-2ry to the chronic use of cortisone drops. Ever since she's been treated with MTX and off and on Predforte. She has also been on glaucoma drops for the last 2 years. My beautiful daughter is now 6 and we discovered last Wednesday that the inflammation in her right eye was at +2 and the pressure in her left eye was at 36. Further tests confirmed permanent irreversible damage to the optic nerve in the left eye with peripheral vision loss (tunnel vision). I don't know/understand how we got to this point seeing as she has had follow up visits every week to two weeks for the last 6 months but what's done is done. The dr said surgery to alleviate the pressure is inevitable to prevent further damage and that in order to do the surgery the pressure has to come down. She is now on Maxidex, Predforte, Xalatan, Combigan, Mydriacil, MTX and Diamox and her rheuma wants to start her on Humira. Devastated does not begin to describe how we feel. WHY??? IT'S NOT FAIR!!!How horrific is it to sit there in the dr's office and be told they want your child to start Humira and that the potential side effects include cancer and MS like symptoms? Insanely horrific. I have spent the last 3 days on an emotional roller coaster and a friend suggested I join some blogs. I don't know if this is going to help me or if it helps others to know my situation but at this point it's worth a try. We started her on the Diamox this morning with no adverse side effects thank God and we are still debating whether or not we will go for the Humira.

The initial phase is the inflammatory phase and is called the innate immune system and the second phase is called the adaptive immune system. Both work in conjunction with one another. The innate immune system is inherited and encompasses defense mechanisms handed down from your ancestors and coded in your genes. The adaptive immune system is a library of infections that you have experienced during your life and the antibody templates to fight them.,It's believed that the innate immune system is responsible for many of the conditions that we suffer from. The initial process is to induce inflammation and deploy cells such as phagocytes to clean up an infection. The inflammation is just an increase in size of the blood vessels to improve the deployment of fighting cells and to clean up after antibodies when the adaptive immune system has done its job.,However in these conditions the inflammatory process just continues and is called auto-inflammatory. The adaptive immune system cannot find anything and is not deployed. The system's start button  has been pressed but the stop button malfunctions.,In all cases it is a genetic coding fault. In some they can identify the gene that is causing the problem e.g. Ankylosing spondolytis. In many they cannot identify the cause.,topic_577375,"15+ attacks in two years, is there anything I can do?",,,2011-05-16 11:18:04,Rob thanks for that brilliant explanation.,topic_577375,"15+ attacks in two years, is there anything I can do?",http://www.facebook.com/nicki.davis.1023,Nicki,2011-05-16 11:37:28,"rob, when you told me last week, it really helped me understand, you just think that your immune system is just 1 thing altogether.",topic_577375,"15+ attacks in two years, is there anything I can do?",https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/564680527/,SarahAuger,,"Hello all, thank you once again for your further responses.

Constant under-treated or untreated uveitis as well as constant steroid drops is asking for trouble: cataract and glaucoma being just two of the most common complications.,"Uveitis which doesn't go away within several months is labelled chronic, and it seems that you have chronic uveitis if I have understood you correctly.

He must have had his reasons, surely.","Some people do find their eyes flare when they have a bad cold, but it doesn't happen to everyone. The thinking goes that an immune system revs up to fight the cold or virus and decides to attack the eyes while its at it. Some doctors believe that the body fighting an infection can be the trigger for some types of uveitis to start in the first place. Then there is infectious uveitis which begins with a pathogen getting into the eye and viral uveitis, such as when the herpes virus gets into an eye. For many of us though, there doesn't need to be a triggering infection for the immune system to have another go at our eyes - it just decides to hold a party there regardless of anything we're doing.",Nicki,thanks,,,I'm not nearly as strict as I used to be though as the medication combo I'm on now is so effective - it's a lot harder to motivate myself to avoid carbs etc when I don't literally feel the pain after eating them...!,Is this something you have or are trying?,"Take care,","This week a new doctor has finally agreed to run tests including x-rays and genetic testing.

This part of the immune system is ancient and is with us from birth and has components handed down about diseases our ancestors encountered.,,,,,,,,,The fisrt part i undersatnde the bilateral anterior uveits and synechiae but not the rest.  The 2nd part do you think they think that he may have jia or not?,thanks,sarah,,"The second part is called the adaptive system which identifies foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses and foreign protein (as in transplanted tissue). This system manufactures antibodies to kill invaders which are then eaten by the macrophages in step one. The system library of encounters with invaders builds over a lifetime and allows the body to cope better. This is why the young and the old are susceptible to disease whilst the middle remain healthy (usually :) ).",Hence the cause of uveitis for many could be a simple injury that causes the innate system to induce inflammation (auto-inflammatory). Under normal circumstances the system should turn off the inflammation but for some unknown reason the genetics of that person has failed and the stop button fails.,Hope that helps you a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rob,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steroid tablets have plenty of side affects themselves and as you say, drops are the better option if you wish to try for a baby.  I have had both drops, injections and tablets to treat intermediate uveitis and iritis at different times. I now have cataracts in both eyes, but I know that when they reach the point of driving me nuts (or stopping me driving) then they can be removed. I always like to remember the fact that in Africa, there is a bus that goes around, and people get their cataract surgery on the bus in 20 minutes - so I tell myself that if they can do that, then they can certainly do mine in a hospital. I know that when they do the surgery we will have to be careful not to cause further inflammation. Also, my consultant tells me that if I get pregnant the hormones might help to settle the iritis anyway, and so you if you are lucky you may come off the drops altogether during your pregnancy.","I know it is a difficult decision. I tried to get pregnant last year, but I find that when I come off my contraceptive it causes my eye to flare up. After 6 months I was fed up and not pregnant, so I went back on the pill for a break. We are trying again now, so every time my eye looks a bit pink I panic. Fingers crossed when I see the consultant in May, I've not got inflammation anywhere.",I think that there are at least 3 of us trying for a baby now on this site! I hope that you get pregnant soon.

This might be a bit different for children and they often receive an additional med before the infusion to help prevent any allergic reaction. I'm careful about avoiding infection of any type - infusions are put back a week and mtx stopped if I have even a cold sore. The nurses are strict about this. Blood checks are done before each infusion and the needle used for this remains in place for the infusion itself - no double stabbing!

Humira is offered first because it is easier to administer, without needing the expense of an infusion clinic. Infusions are time consuming, 3 hours for us, where Humira is a quick shot at home. We go to the clinic prepared to keep Braiden entertained. I bring snacks, drinks, changes of clothing, my laptop for WiFi, movies, toys, music, etc. We ask for a shot of Lidocaine at the IV site so that placing the IV is pain-free, particularly if they have to dig around for a wiggly vein.

When I first started immunosuppression, I was too scared to take vitamins or anything in case it would stimulate the immune system, just when I was intentionally suppressing it. The only exception to this was Vitamin D - I got my levels tested (and highly advise people with uveitis to do the same...) and was low. My childhood family dr had pointed me in this direction, as well as to the",Vitamin D Council,"website - Vitamin D plays quite a role in the immune system, and here in the UK we simply don't see the sun enough most of the year...","As you have probably gathered , I really don't want to go back to Caen hospital.",I will let you know in 6 months if I have had to go there or not!,good luck to all in the same boat,Mark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I was just wondering....

But along Tatiana lines it will not do any harm (fingers crossed it does some good, somehow). But I do keep ending up with a lot of not eaten but fermenting spinach and kale. While uveitis is a completely different kettle of fish - my Dad is convinced that eating too many tomatoes gives him gout. If you knew my Dad... You would realise why this adds to the theory that it might help or some food aggravate existing problems. Also, just randomly I was chatting to another Mum at the uveitis clinic; her daughter was a lot older than Riley and she had JIA and uveitis and was experiencing a JIA flare. Anyway, the Mum brought up that the biggest help, while we were discussing pros and cons of injecting MTX, was cutting out process sugar etc and almost going raw. Going raw caused the most noticeable improvement to the arthritis symptoms. Have no idea if this was in combination with MTX or not.- I think the processes involved in uveitis are  more complicated (the eyes being a protected site and all). And, anyway, going raw (or cutting out processed sugar) is not a 'do able' reality (without a lot of unnecessary emotional pain at meal time) for my family, but I do think a pineapple smoothie will make a nice supplement.

I'd read about leaky gut too, as well as a specific theory for Ankylosing Spondylitis - and thought I'd test it for a few weeks.

Interesting.",I know this is an old thread - any further info please?,I would love to believe that i could help my daughters eyes with natural methods.  She is 10 and experiencing a flare of Uveitis.  Currently on MTX and striods (drops and oral) and soon to start humira.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A close friend was going through cancer treatment too so I started reading alongside his wife - Chris Woolam's website,Cancer Active,"has a huge amount of information. It was info I was hearing from multiple sources, and when I thought about it my immunosuppressant was indeed also used (at very different doses) as a chemo drug - so applying some of the things he recommended made complete sense for me. I ended up changing what I cook with (no more non-stick), got rid of BPA, changed my skincare and make-up etc etc - and also doing things to help detox. Ultimately all drugs are toxins in some form, I want to help my body use the drugs effectively and then get rid of whatever it doesn't need. So I looked into ways to detox - epsom baths, occasional juice fasts (I too love Jason Vale - heard him speak earlier this year), also I like some of Patrick Holford's recipes which help the liver.","Our bodies are phenomenal - but I think of it as a tipping point. Years of not looking after myself too well (stress, not enough exercise, bad diet...) all likely contributed in some way. I for example needed prescription hay fever meds too for the first time in the year after I first had uveitis - now, I'm in a much stronger position (I've not even taken an OTC hay fever med so far this year!)",I encourage you to watch Jason Vale's documentary,Super Juice Me,if you haven't already... it was very odd to see Humira as one of the drugs in the documentary when it lives in my fridge too! Eye opening.,"The leaky gut theory has been touched on already - but this is important, and there is more and more research now coming out about it (ultimately there is so much that medicine is still learning about!) I found the work of Dr Natasha Campbell-McBride very interesting - especially after hearing the difference diet made in a colleague's autistic daughter. So I actively work on continually doing things to heal my gut and keep it healthy and happy (bearing in mind that the drugs likely upset the balance a little) - good quality probiotics, prebiotic foods, kefir...","I'll have to admit that I don't watch my diet as much on Humira as I used to - but when I do, I feel better overall. The holistic approach makes the most sense to me - I absolutely needed the drugs, BUT I want to support that with a lifestyle. Sadly we don't (yet?) get any of this info from the doctors as a rule, they're just not trained enough in that area. I have also recently started taking turmeric supplements - after reading that it's thought to block the production of TNF-alpha... the very action that Humira is after as an anti-TNF... Fresh turmeric would likely be best, but this is easier and a lot more palatable to me.","There is a LOT of info here - sorry!

2011-09-05 11:17:21,"Hi all i'm new to the forum and hoping you may be able to offer some advice. My daughter Helena who is just 6 has been on 10mg (injection) methotrexate for her jia and uveitis since she was 2.Unfortunately we have never really got the uveitis under control and she is constantly requiring steroid drops 8 x day at moment. Her consultant now wants her to go on the Humira trial, which i'm really nervous about. I think the reason i'm so concerned is that we are fortunate Helena still has good vision and thankfully as yet no damage to her eyes. Have or are any of you in a similar position?

Your nervousness about Humira is shared by other parents here and I expect several will be along soon to share their thoughts with you.,"In one way you are lucky to be offered a place in this trial because the likelihood is that if Helena receives the Humira, her uveitis will be controlled and you could get her off those drops, sagfeguarding her eyes from the side effects of steroid. However, other immunosuppressants agents can do the same job and the potential side effects of those may be more palatable than those listed for Humira. Equally, the monitoring for side effects for those on the Humira trial is stringent and the drug would be withdrawn at the first sign of a problem.",You can read about the other drugs in our treatment section and perhaps this might give you a clearer idea about alternatives to Humira and what you feel most comfortable about where Helena is concerned.,topic_843920,Anxious about starting Humira,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2011-09-06 15:25:21,"Hi Jacqui,","Hopefully the new section titled ""Humira"" at the very top of the page far right will help you.",If you have a specific question which is not answered please let me know as I can add it to the Q&A page published today.

He is on Methotrexate 20mg injection, predforte eye drops, atropine eye drops, and Humira 40mg injections. I would say that as far as what your child is taking, that is a very small dose! I did struggle with the decision to start Humira because of the potential risks. We played with the Methotrexate and predforte dose some before I decided enough was enough. A risk with JIA is kidney failure so the rheumy feared we would be heading down that road very soon if we didn't step up to Humira.

Fortunately i think Helena was diagnosed quite early as she was only 2yrs old, and, although the current mtx dose is obviously way too low to treat the uveitis, she is very well otherwise so i think that is perhaps one of the reasons they have never increased the mtx.

I also met some others of hi clients later on, and felt their cosmetic appearance was just fine.  Yes, I could tell the prosthetics from the normal eyes, due to lack of pupil dilation, and subtle differences of eye movement.

I was refitted with a new and larger prosthetic.  Because tis is a bit heavier, it has gradually stretched my lower lid and socket tissues have settled a bit more, so think I will now need a minor procedure to snug up the lid a bit, and think it will improve the appearance more---I hope insurance will pay for this!

2011-12-14 21:24:04,I'm new to the forum but have read it previously to see what other experiences people are having.  My 7 yr old has Uveitis and is on Methotrexate.  This wasn't effective orally so moved to sub-cut.  This was effective for 6 months but now we have 1+ again in one eye.  Back on drops!  She was considered for Humira in the summer but then the inflammation settled so we carried on with Mtx only.  We are back to the clinic tomorrow to discuss.  I feel quite confused.  Hopefully all will become clear. Also really don't want her to have to cope with more injections as we are struggling with the Mtx as it is.

Three weeks later my left eye flared but not as badly and I commenced the drops regime once again.

This year I have had only 4 flares of uveitis and minimal joint and bowel involvement and my wonderful Rheumatologist decided to try me on methotrexate tablets. These made me feel incredibly sick and gave me a terrible upset stomach. I stopped taking this after two doses as I decided the benefit has to outweigh the side effects and this didn't. Ten months later and my rheumy decided that injecting methotrexate might avoid the gastrointestinal side effects and whoa what a difference. I injected it and felt fine for three days and then felt as though I was losing my mind and spent 5 days crying uncontrollably for no apparent reason. This was interspersed with volcanic anger which I just cope with. I now find myself wondering what next? I was told I probably have seronegative arthritis but that isn't definitive as a diagnosis.

I was again referred and the opthamologist was concerned that there was evidence of optic nerve swelling, so took bloods and referred me for an MRI the next day.","When I got to the hospital, a nurse came to ask if there was any reason my kidney function would be dropping.  I said no.  I was admitted and given what felt like every test under the sun (x-rays, MRI, CT scan, ultra sounds, lumbar puncture, kidney biopsy, blood tests and urine tests etc).  By the time they had decided on a diagnosis of TINU, my kidney function had dropped to 20%!",Definitely need to see uveitis specialist.,NSAID drops in eye don't usually work.,I took a drop of steroid each day when I had a few cells that lingered.

My kidney function has increased more slowly than they hoped (I'm now at 37%).,"I remained flare free until the kidney Dr started to reduce the predinisolone tablets (which obviously come with their own pile of side effects).  I had a flare in early February of this year and have been battling with it ever since.  It clears, they taper the drops, it comes back.  The pressure was starting to build in the eye so they diagnosed another drop to reduce this.","The last appointment there was only a couple of cells in one eye, so the opthamologist gave me Acular to try.  A few weeks later, the clear eye flared, so it was back to the Maxidex in that one, then a week later the eye being treated with the Acular flared, so I had to start using the maxidex for a few days in that one too.  Pressures at this point were 24 in the Acular eye and 15 in the Maxidex eye.  I'm currently on 4 drops a day, Acular in my left eye and Maxidex in my right.","Fortunately, the eye clinic and opthamologist are good in that I have regular appointments and a number to call if i have any concerns.

So, she took me to my GP and she said that I just had conjunctiveits, an so did another GP. However, one GP diagnosed me with Paediatric Uveitis. My mum took me to hospital and the doctors ran a few tests. Then, I was sent up to Opthlamology and met a very nice eye specialist. Ever since I was diagnosed, I've had bloods taken, measured, eyes measured vice versa. However, in some cases, this condition isn't all that bad. On the 22nd December 2016, I went to Bristol to check out my eyes in CTO. I also had my BP done.","That's pretty much my story so far. A few tips for anyone having Uveitis. 1. Don't stress about this condition, it is temporary and not very serious. 2. If gets worse, see a Consultant in Opthlamology immediately. And 3. Ask your doctor if there is any treatment. For example, I'm on both eyes dexemethasone on alternate days and 12.5 mg of methatrexate every Tuesday. I want to be a Doctor when I'm older, I want to aim in my early years for Speciality Registrar, emergency medicene (A&E) so I won't be dealing with all this. However, I sure am learning a lot.

I have also read another paper that says there is no increased risk. That is the problem, we don't know other contributing factors. Drug companies have to label absolutely every possibility.... I know all this but and very worried for my baby. Terrified of him losing more sight and terrified of cancer but I do know him losing more sight is guaranteed, other side effects listed must be extremely, extremely rare or doctors just wouldn't be allowed to prescribe it. My own GP said that they (I assume other people at the practice who use it) have found it very effective. I have to say we have had great support at Bristol with regards to help control the uveitis, advice on using meto jet pen and access to phycologist.","But I do whole heartedly believe the benefits outweigh the risks. But am arranging to meet an opthalomogist privately without Riley so that I can ask lots of questions and process answers outside the usual hectic hospital environment - so I have time to process information and think of all those questions I forgot to ask.

2015-05-08 17:56:03,Hello all. Since i last posted about maya who is four with anterior idiopathic uveitis in her right eye .things have changed. We discovered she had the start of a cataract despite only having the condition just 12 mths. She started methotrexate last week and up to now seems ok. However two days ago she started with gunky eyes. It was def conjunctivitis as it was doing the rounds at school. She s had this before in her good eye since diagnosis but not in her affected eye. My question is can this lead to a flare? Im super sensitive atm and our next appt is in 18 days. Her eyes are ever so slightly inflammed and sticky more so in the morning. And her affected eye looked puffy this morning. She is still on two drops pred forte and cyclopentolate twice a day. Shhe s now on antibiotic eye drops four times a day. We spoke to her consultant who said to treat her with antibiotics and see how she is in four/five days. Has anybody else experienced this? Am i being silly worrying? Im turning into a massive worrier since her diagnosis!!!

I do not think personally it leads to a flare.  I got conjuctivitis several times whilst on steroid drops, it basically reduces resistance to infection so makes you a bit more vulnerable and as she is so young she is more likely  to touch her eye.    Hopefully when the methotrexate kicks in she maybe able to stop the steroid drops and hence stop the cataract getting worse and be less prone to infection.  Hope it clears up quickly which I am sure it will with antibiotic drops.",Tania,topic_4763906,advice on conjunctivitis please again!!!,,,2015-05-16 08:45:09,"Hope Maya's conjunctivitis has completely cleared by now!

Asking your doctor tomorrow which applies to you will help your understanding of what to expect.","In many cases, the pressure will be lowered through the use of glaucoma drops and/or glaucoma pills. When the rise in pressure has been caused by steroid, if steroid is still needed for inflammation, some doctors will eventually suggest glaucoma surgery so that it's safe, pressure wise, to continue using steroid, others will try to balance the use of steroid with the pressure lowering therapy. The alternative to these is to be on effective systemic immunosuppressant therapy without steroid (or with very low dose steroid) to control inflammation.",I hope you are told that your eye pressure has reduced tomorrow and your doctor has a plan for moving forward.,topic_2016790,Advice on eye pressure problems re uveitis ?,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,,"Thanks Maxine, I am in for trabeculectomy surgery next week which I am actually really pleased / relieved about (after feeling quite apprehensive about it at first) having had a couple of months trying the eye drops solution route.

The trabeculectomy surgery went really well thanks and after lots of follow up visits to the hospital to check the eye pressures, the pressures have now come down from the high 40's in both eyes pre-op to 15 in the operated eye and mid 20s in the other eye nearly 4 weeks post op. I got some fluid coming in behind my retina in the operated eye but there was no detachment of  the macula thank goodness and now the vision is slowly coming back to pre-op level. The vision is very foggy so I'm assuming its just the eye settling /something to do with the retinal fluid and /or the Maxidex drops that I'm putting in every 2 hours. I went to the hospital a few days ago and I do not have to go back for a whole month so after virtually living there over the past few weeks( or it feels like it anyway !) its a huge relief to have a break !

I had the sleeping problem with the steroids at first but after 2 or 3 weeks I suddenly could get to sleep as normal so possibly the body starts to adjust to the medication (?). I did put a bit of weight on around half a stone and kept it to that by continuing to eat all the things i enjoyed as normal - but just took the portion sizes down a wee bit and that seemed to work . I had the moonface for a few months but as soon as they tapered the dose down past 30mg i seemed to lose alot of it so that was great.I also had fluid at the back of my eye (underneath the retinas) at the time of my cataract operations so thats interesting as our cases sound somewhat similar.

Tania",,,,,,,"I was just having a look at the forum for the first time in ages yesterday and saw your post about your cataracts and I can really understand all your worries and concerns and I hope you are managing to cope okay given the circumstances. I ended up turning up one weekend at the hospital i was being treated at, and saying that I could not cope with the cataracts anymore and then it was all action stations. My consultant was very understanding.  I developed cataracts really quickly during the first 6 months of 2012. My hospital did cataract surgery on one eye in The May of 2012 and then in the other eye two month later. Although i was scared when the day of the op came i was so relieved as I could no longer see peoples faces etc and it was straightforward. I remember looking out of the hosp ward window the day after the op and marvelling how i could see cars going by and even though my vision was still blurry all i could see before that was a really horrible  fuzzy outline of houses and trees ie i could barely see anything.  Following the cataract operation, I noticed a gradual improvement in vision over a period of a couple of months . I also went onto the oral steroids and immunosuppression at that point (The immuno medication was Cyclosporin). I was wary of taking medication but I think it prevented further vision loss and my oral steroids have been tapered down to 15mg a day so i am now losing my 'moonface'look !. I do have macular odema in one eye which came on in August 2012 . i am not sure whether this was a result of cataract surgery though. I may get some steroid injections for that but i am a steroid responder so hosp are being cautious for now. Following the surgery from memory I was putting in Maxidex drops every couple of hours at first then 4 times a day. The eye pressure seems to be sorting itself out although goes up and down still but is more stable. Is your hospital managing your eye pressure entirely thrnough drops ? Have they talked to you about the inflammation and when the time mught be right for cataract surgery ? Sorry for the long email and hope this helps x",,"thank you so much for detailed reply - am having difficulty time coping with this the losing vision part daily.  Still have good eye (although have bad feeling about it) but cannot see faces anymore with bad eye and  find it hard to deal with.  Glasses no longer make a differnce when I read although maybe its the fluid.  Also was on Cyclosporin but ended up in hosptial as didnt agree with me so am on mxt and 60mg of predisnolone and maxidex x6 a day since 5 days but not happy about it as am sure it makes cataract worse by the day.  Have lots of fluid at the back of eye but have Moorfields tomorrow so am going to ask lots of questions.  I was due for op in March for cataract but only if it had been quiet but it never is.  I am hoping the immunosuppresant kick in and then maybe it will be quiet enough for op.  I was hoping that I would be able to not keep taking oral steroids too (they keep me up all night) but I see you  on 15mg, will you get off them?  Am starving myself at the moment as well as don't want to balloon and keep reading about moon face.  Do you cope ok and think one day there will be an end?

2019-01-11 22:21:30,"Hey I’m not very good at telling quick stories but here goes. At the beginning of December 2018 I noticed I had completely blurred vision in my left eye and it flashed all the time even when I shut my eyes so the next day I went to my optician who after lots of tests referred me to the hospital ophthalmologist that day. After examining me he felt I’d had some kind of brain haemorrhage or stroke as I have a pre-existing life limiting neurological condition which causes haemorrhage but I didn’t have any headache or any of my normal symptoms. After a CT scan done a week later it was decided to do an MRI. I knew my sight was getting worse but didn’t know what to do, I went back to my optician after Christmas and he referred me back to the hospital the next day so I saw another ophthalmologist and after all sorts of tests, scans and bloods he told me I have intermediate uveitis and gave me 40mg of prednisone to start immediately. That was on the 28th December I’ve been taking the steroids everyday and I’ve been attending the hospital outpatients clinic weekly I’ve had an MRI, a chest x-ray an eye angiogram and weekly scans of the retina so I’ve to cut the prednisone down to 30mgs next week but I haven’t noticed any difference in my blurred vision and it flashes all the time. Will I get my sight back will the flashing stop and also the ophthalmologist is referring me to a uveitis specialist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow does anyone have any experience of the clinic?

He further stated that anything that happens to a child during clinical trials of a drug must be reported to the drug agency so anything that any child experiences will show up in the ""potential' side effects, even if it only happened to one child. I also asked if the types of cancers that were seen were highly treatable cancers with good success rates or cases with terminal outcomes.

I wish it would just all go away.","If you are in the UK, there is a study going on into the use of humira in children. If you are part of this study, your daughter will be monitored closely for side effects and you'll have the assurance that the drug would be stopped should there be an indication that all is not going well.",Humira works incredibly well at stopping inflammation and getting people off the eye drops which themselves cause damage to sight. It's likely to save the sight in your daughter's right eye.,"There are other mothers here who are placed in the same position as you with very young children offered, or about to begin, humira. They are better able to respond to you than I can. As an adult, in much the same position as your daughter, I didn't hestitate to start infliximab, a drug similar to humira. My uveitis had already given me periods of blindness and badly affected the quality of my life, so I knew the alternative. For me, the risks were worth it and these past three years, infliximab has given me back my life. I'm just grateful I was offered it.","Equally, this past year, OV was invited to visit the Royal National College for the Blind to see how the blind are rehabilitated, educated and trained for employment. The RNC is an incredible place and I know that I would have coped with my period of blindness much better, had I known such high quality help was available.","Take care and i wish you all the best,",Cheryl,,,,,,,,,,,,Thank you for this website....,Eva,"[Last edited Jun 13, 2011 17:01:41]","-----

Over the last six mths we have been gradually reducing the drops every 2 weeks and were hopeful that this episode was over after being reduced to pred sol every other day. Next wednesday we were going to stop the drops completely, her vison was fantastic and her pupil had returned to normal and everything was looking positve until tuesday. I got a call from school to say her eye had been getting redder by the hr, so i collected hwr and we got an appt in manchester the next morning. By this point it was obvious as she was photophobic and her pupil was fixed again. We are now back to square one 2 hrly pred forte atropine and an ointment for night and im gutted!! I was possibly niave and hopeful that this was ending and now tje shadow of mwthatrexaite hangs over us again. Can anyone tell me when they say enough with the drops ?

Itoo worry about the blood tests, the illness, and mostly the emotional and social impact on my daughter as she becomes different from her friends. There is so much to think about. I am hopeful however as it seems ur lb has been on pred forte for quite alot longer than maya so maybe they will let us ride this out again and keep her in a maintenance dose longer, they think they reduced her drops to quickly which resulted in this flare.

My younger son was diagnosed with JIA and uveitis when he was just turned 8.  We went through the emergency IV steroid treatment and all the eye drops you could think of (sometimes to be administered on an hourly basis).  But it was not really controlled until he started the MTX.  We worried about it for ages (and read all the research papers we could find) but chose to go with the injection route rather than orally because of the greater efficacy.  When he was 8 he hated the injections and sometimes it could take a couple of hours to persuade him that it was good for him (especially when he was feeling fine!) but he did not feel well afterwards.  We were given some folate tablets for him to take part-way through the week and he also now takes ondansetron to curb the nausea.  After a couple of years things were looking good and the medication stopped, but 8 months later the uveitis returned.","He tried the oral methotrexate after that, but it wasn't very effective, so he chose to go back onto the injections.

2012-02-22 12:57:54,"Hi, my daughter who is now 8 1/1 was diagnosed with oligoarticular at 2 1/2, she had repeated flare-ups in both knees and ankles so was put on methatrexate (15mg) for 3 years. She was weaned off this last year and she had 6 months in remission.  She had never had uveitis that we knew of as obviously the methatrexate would have kept this at bay.  However, in November 2011 her joints began to flare up for which she had joint injections.  These have worked thus far but she has developed uveitis in January 2012 which has upset us so much.  She is on Prednol but apprarently this was discontinued in October last year temporarily and not due to be reproduced until May this year.  Her doctor tells us nothing and I have just found out although it is improving in her left eye it is persisting in the right eye yet they have reduced the dosage in both eyes.  I am worrying sick, I just wish they put her on MTX again as she had little side effects other than a bit of sickness after the injection.",topic_1302563,new to website,http://www.facebook.com/laurajanie,LauraLightfoot,2012-02-22 21:57:02,Hiya thanks for your reply. At the time of booking the injection only 1 joint had flared but it soon spread to the other knee. I mentioned MTX but they want to put it off due to her sickness and the fact that she developed a number of ear infections which has led to hearing loss and she now has hearing aids. Being cynical as I am a project manager on an PCT contract I worry it is to do with funding but I hope I am wrong! I pestered to see the rheumatologist quickly to discuss the uveitis and we did get to see them soon after but I am made to feel like a whining mother by questioning the care she receives (although we were lucky enough to see a pediatric rheumatologist from New Cross). Due to seeking a second opinion a number of years ago I don't feel I have built up the good relationship and we often see different consultants. At that second opinion we were told by BCH that if she ever developed uveitis she would need to be treated there but at Stafford they seem reluctant to transfer care.

When you attend, ask if the examination of your son's eye showed features which are suggestive of viral, parasitic or other causes of infectious uveitis if you haven't already done this. (Children can both pick up infectious causes themselves such as the cold sore virus, toxoplasmosis or chickenpox and inherit an infection from their mother while in the womb). If there were features suggestive of an infectious cause, this will explain why the full panel of testing was not carried out. If they saw no clinical features of an infectious cause, then ask for the auto immune marker blood tests and x-rays for TB and joint problems to set your mind at rest.","At the moment, technically, your son does not have recurrent or chronic uveitis in his eye. One course of steroid drops has failed and this is not uncommon. Should your son's eye be clear once off the drops and then flares up again a third time within days or weeks, if he were my son, I'd be pushing for referral to specialist care and I'd still be pushing for this if his eye flared again within three to four months.",topic_5538941,Can anyone advise me on how I get my son referred please?,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,,"I guess I was extrapolating from my own experience.

This means the cataract is developing on the back of the lens and scattering the light that enters the eye so that it doesn't fall on the retina the way it should.","The most important things to keep in mind are that eyes need to have been inflammation free for three months before surgery so that the risk of post op. complications is reduced. Secondly, you need to keep your son's consultant informed when the cataracts start to affect his vision. The visual acuity check at appointments is often conducted in conditions which enable people to see the best they can and does not always reflect the sight people have in different light conditions when there is a posterior cataract.

Don't think it is guaranteed that you will get AS. But I would ask for a referral to an uveitis specialist. They will know the answers to your questions. However, they probably will not give you a definitive answer on that one. Given that you have had to have a steriod injection I really think you should see a specialist. Don't delay on that one particularly because you are worried, it might help settle some of your very understandable anxieties.","You can email OV and they can point you in the right direction with regard to uveitis consultants. You can get a referral direct from your GP. Just be warned don't get lumbered with any old ophthalmologist - not all specialists are made equal. Probably, also shouldn't write this but also do some homework with regard to excess steriod use, as little as 750 drops can contribute the the start of cataracts. Though uncontrolled uveitis can do the same.","2. Do as exactly as the Doctor advises with the eye drops despite what I have written above. The quicker you tapper them, the greater the chance of a flare.

And as this is now a pre-existing condition would cost you a fortune if you could even get cover. The scheme that I am in with my work gave a very limited choice of hospitals and consultants. Even getting to see a local Ophthalmology consultant privately in the clinic that he practices from was a load of hassle. And it also transpires that the specialists (",http://www.uveitis.org/patients/list-of-specialists/international,) that are closer to me in Birmingham and Bristol all practice exclusively for the NHS. Also remember that some Health Insurance schemes won't cover chronic diseases.,My recommendation would be to get an appointment with Ophthalmology consultant and if you're not totally happy with your treatment (validate it against your own research) then ask for a referral (either from your GP or Consultant) to a regional Uveitis specialist.

One of my friends immediately blamed the condition on me ""eating too much meat"", which hurt me so much I couldn't talk with him for several days.","Hope your eye has improved by now. Others have given all the details, so I just want to second the idea of getting an uveitis specialist ASAP. Because uveitis is a rare condition, not many opthmalogists have enough experience and training to deal with it. Therefore, with a good specialist you will have the best chance to: (1) locate the cause; and (2) administer the steroid dosage (which is very important if you are getting several flares per year - you wouldn't want to get steroid - induced problems to add to the list). In my experience the consultant fee is lower than Maxine's estimation, and once the condition settles down you'll only need a check-up once in several months, which is not too scary.","Like Pete, I also think Prof. Aliffe is a reliable specialist.","I'm not an opthmalogist to advise about this, but perhaps you may try to notice unusual things before a flare? For example in my case, very often eye pressure rises after staying up late (I used to be a night owl). I'm now going to sleep before midnight everyday and seems like my eye pressure is a lot more stable during a flare.

Don't be scared (though I was terrified on my sons behalf), but look so that you can ask your consultant questions with regards to other treatments, like Methotrexate. Please don't worry about that though...  But you need to know about it so that you can have an informed discussion with a consultant.",Do you know what I wish I had done in retrospect. I wished I had pushed for immune suppressants sooner for my son. I know that sounds hard hitting and MIGHT well NOT apply to you but I can't tell you how much I wished I had pushed much harder and much faster for MTX for my son. So make sure you know about this stuff early on. If it all clears up great but if it doesn't you are not playing catch up.,,,"Becca's given you comprehensive information already, so just adding a bit more sympathy really.","The HLA B27 means you have a higher than average chance of developing one of the auto immune conditions associated with it, not that you will develop one. It's worth seeing a rheumatologist should you notice joint pain, bowl changes, or skin problems.","People with AK uveitis say that a slow taper off the drops works best, so with you having the HLA B27 even though you haven't got AK, it's best to keep going with the drop every hour for a week. (Specialists keep some of us on drops for 2 weeks for each stage of the taper to reduce the chance of a flare up shortly after the dropping finishes).",I never expected responses so quickly and so detailed. Thank you all for the guidance and help :),,,,,,,,2)I've only ever had to do hourly drops for 3-4 days - if i feel the uveitis has cleared after this time is it safe to go to 2 hourly or shall i do a whole week of 1 hourly as advised? - i'm not sleeping well and feel depressed as a result,3) do alcohol or smoking (socially) have any links to uveitis?,4) will i get AAU every year from now or is there a chance it will burn out? I'm worried about this due to my work where my eyes are important,5) whats the best health insurance? or will they not cover me know ive been diagnosed?,"My specialist says smokers have a harder time with uveitis, so if you can cut out the social smoking, it will help.","Steroid drops going into the eye every waking hour might be contributing to your sleeplessness if the steroid is getting into your blood stream. Putting a finger over the tear duct corner of your eye for a couple of minutes after a drop goes in reduces the chance of steroid getting into your system and this might help a bit. Have to say though, that wouldn't have helped me because it was the worry that stopped me sleeping.","The frequency of flare ups varies from person to person. If you're getting flare ups several times a year, you should see a specialist to find out if other treatments are more appropriate. Specialist uveitis clinics are generally reserved for those with uveitis in both eyes and those with chronic uveitis in one eye. It's worth seeing a specialist privately if you can't get NHS referral to a specialist clinic - does wonders for peace of mind and learning about the treatment options best suited for you.","So glad i found this forum, i was feeling so alone, all my friends and family are so ignorant with the condition, that all they ever say is 'it's about time you should go and get it sorted out' or 'it must be an eye infection just get some drops'","thanks again, and i hope with my journey i can help someone else on here also","Good luck,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Your uveitis might well clear and it is only in one eye but honestly, it can be persistent but only a specialist will be able to advise you about the specifics of your case.

Some people, but not all people, are told to wake themselves up every few hours to put in drops. The number of drops is also monitored incase they cause eye pressure to rise. Doctors probably assume that we're asleep for eight hours when they make the decision about drops and don't tell us to use them during the night.","Are you going back to clinic early next week?

Im slightly worried as I am on drops that dilate my eyes and I know this is to keep the lens from sticking but also figured that its to allow more light into my eyes, nly if Im sleeping all the time I cant be getting any light to my eye. I am currently taking prednisolone acetate drops (every hour), maxitrol eye ointment at night and mydrilate drops twice a day (my eye doesnt seem to be dilating though). Th pain etc is still really intense but Im not sure if this is because I only started on this treatment yesterday. Was on maxidem drops before alone (with mydrilate) but didnt seem to be working so was changed - weird as it has always worked before.

It was really good that you sought help immediately about your eye and I hope the Pred and dilating drop have started to make a difference.,"The suspected AK and uveitis may well be connected. When you go back to the eye clinic, if you haven't already done so, tell the doc about your referral to rheumatology. The eye clinic can order blood tests for suspected autoimmune conditions and the results may provide a bit more evidence for the AK you think you suffer from.",What happens next really depends on how your eye responds to treatment with drops and then the taper off them. It also depends on the AK and what is needed treatment wise for that. You're absolutely right about the treatment for AK also controlling,"uveitis, but some would reverse the argument and say their uveitis treatment works a treat on their AK!

Hopefully, the drops will be effective and there will be a big improvement by the time you go back.","I have both AS and uveitis, both well controlled at the moment, although in my case the uveitis preceded the back issues by a number of years.

Turns out that yes, in my case they were connected...","It sounds like your rheumatology referral is already in progress, as Maxine has said definitely mention that at your next eye appointment. If any tests are done, try to get hold of a copy of the results yourself to take to the rheumy - at least that way you'll know they've seen it! The investigations that were done after my 3rd uveitis flare were blood tests, including screening for the HLA-B27 marker (which I am +ve for... although it is possible to be -ve and still have AS, although harder to diagnose - and being HLA-B27+ is only one of the factors of the AS diagnosis, on it's own it means nothing!). I think they also checked for rheumatoid factor and inflammation markers for completeness, but HLA-B27 was the most useful there. X-rays were also done of my sacroiliac joint and chest. The problem with x-rays is that they may not show anything, as it can take years for radiographic changes to show up, even if inflammation is present - once I got to a rheumy he sent me for an MRI which clearly showed SI inflammation. I would suggest that you see if they want to send you for tests next week and ask specifically to be screened for the genetic marker HLA-B27 - one recommendation for B27+ uveitis is to taper off the pred drops quite slowly!!",topic_1467202,"Another newbie, - Any AS and Uveitis sufferers",http://twitter.com/AnkeMW,AnkeMW,2012-04-09 14:34:37,"Thanks for the replies, feeling much better and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it is a one off attack :)",topic_1467202,"Another newbie, - Any AS and Uveitis sufferers",http://www.facebook.com/eve.ellison,EveEllison,2012-04-09 22:33:26,"Hi Eve.

The scale runs from 1 to 5 in units of ten cells with 5 being 50+ and 1 being between 10 and 19. The doctors can usually tell if you've had it before since signs of old inflammation can be  left in the eye.,"Some people are lucky and only ever have one attack of uveitis, or have attacks with years of being inflammation free between them.","I've already had two x-rays on my back one 6 years ago and one a month ago and they have compared them and found that there is thickening in the sacroiliac joints, my lower back does not move much anymore however as I am one of the lucky bendy people (hyperflexibility) so my hips and rest of my back do the bending for me :) and I am excerise mad so when fatigue or pain does not get me I'm really active.","Well, crossed fingers for you here too...! Glad you're feeling better already.",Well things have started to move at last. Went to see the GP today. Been booked in for Gene test and some other tests and the GP has spoken to hospital and turned everything over to the Rheumatologist (is that what you call them?!),I've also been passed on to gyno as when they did the last x-ray of my lower back they found a demoid cyst on my ovary so that will need to be removed as it is the size of a satsuma! Not causing me any problems but apparently it will do if it keeps growing. It shows up on x-rays as they can grow bone and teeth! So completely unrelated but another thing to get sorted.,The uveitis that has hurried all this along is not feeling too great today. The last few days the redness had been going and it felt great but today a load new red blood vessels have appeared and a banging ache :( Should be getting my letter through from the eye hospital tomorrow so will know when I'm to see them next. Is this normal for it to feel better some days than others or should it be feeling better each day? Still on 1 drop every hour.,Glad things are moving along - although sorry that there seem to be so many things at once!! It does sound like you'll get some coordinated care though which is always helpful.,"Hope your letter has arrived - are you still due to go back to the eye hospital this weekend?

I am a little annoyed as if the AK is confirmed I might not have ever got to the point of having Uveitis as the inflammation should have been under control.",Anyway as I will be going back in a week is there any questions you think I should ask the Dr? and anything tat I should be proactive in asking for?,Thanks Eve x,,Enjoy those eggs!,Maxine,,"I think this is the thing that other people arond me find the hardest to accept, that I can be crying in the morning in pain but on a good week can play netball, run 10Km races and do all the fun outdoory stuff I love!

I'm not sure if you've heard of Carol Sinclair or the low starch diet - she's written a book (which I was able to find in my local library) which I found very interesting - and which really helped my back when I followed it - really useful for me to help control symptoms before diagnosis!

My eyes blur quite a lot too, and like you I wear glasses already (although I am rather short sighted!). After one of my first flares, I asked the same question and was told my vision shouldn't really change any more - I think by this stage I may even have been on my last steroid drop or even off them - so duly went off to get another prescription made. As I'm so short sighted though, thin lenses are really expensive so I didn't actually order new glasses - just as well as a few weeks later they were back to my normal! I think my prescription now is the same as it was before all of this started, even though I've had some pretty severe flares along the way - there is early cataract in one eye from steroid use but it currently doesn't affect me too much. Hopefully, the same will be true for you - otherwise yes, you could just replace the lens in one eye (but I would wait...!)",Many of us take lists of written down questions in to appointments as there is the tendency to forget things (especially if you've been waiting ages...) - although I've even managed to forget to ask a question which WAS written down in front of me! :) The theory to counteract that problem is to hand the questions over as you go in (make sure they're prioritised though),Hope your appointment letters come through soon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Take care,",-Anke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My son is 7, sure he is tall for is age (and may I say very handsome, I am his mum) but I am guessing that you are probably a bit bigger and heavier. Might be worth questioning your dose with your current consultant. Given that 15mg/week is the maximum for Riley and he is only about 128cm tall. I am sure your maximum dose for height/ weight could be more. Larger doses can be given as injections which tend to help bypass some of the more unpleasant side effects.

But I think better to be on methotrexate before problems develop than after. I can't remember if I told you but Riley has been diagnosed with a small cataract in his good eye. I was devasted. It is awful to think that he might have to face surgery in his full seeing eye. Maybe if he had been put on MTX sooner the cataract wouldn't have developed. But ultimately, you have to do with what you feel comfortable with. If the uveitis is just in one eye, i don't think I would be quite so worried. But surgery for secondary glaucoma or cataract is no picnic and certainly not an easy option.","I wish we had put him on MTX sooner. Also, I have been told that small children tend to tolerate MTX much better, I know that is cold comfort. Before, Riley's uveitis became very complicated he had 20/20 vision in both eyes.

Even at the eye hospital Riley is at now, they think 1 drop is OK. So you really have to risk the benefits vs risks yourself. I think that because only one eye is affected it makes the decision harder. Really with Riley or bilateral uveitis it is a no brainer,.... Mmmmmm.

What to do next is a really tough decision.,"I think I would be guided by what the ophthalmologist says. Three flares in ten months is distressing, you don't know how the uveitis will progress and this latest flare without obvious symptoms as you rightly say, worries you. Has Maya's specialist treated many children with unilateral uveitis for years with steroid drops and the children retained full vision, sustained no damage to structures in their eyes and undergone no surgery at the point the uveitis came to an end? Although your daughter has no underlying disease, there are JIA and uveitis statistics on the internet concerning the sight retained by children treated only with steroid for years. Looking at these might give an additional perspective on treating with eye drops alone.","Another way of looking at is to think that the mtx therapy now might be only for two years plus weaning off time and your daughter's immune response is altered so that the uveitis comes to an end and her eye is undamaged by the complication of cataract and the possibility of raised ocular pressure. Staying on a drop a day means you are waiting for the uveitis to run its course, however long that takes, and each flare has the potential to cause damage. You've already seen a little of what uncontrolled inflammation can do through your daughter's pupil sticking.","I'm more ambivalent than many others are about the issue of 'one eye only,' especially where the young are concerned. They have a life time of seeing ahead of them, the majority will live far longer than we can expect to and who knows what will happen to the good, non uveitic eye, as the child grows and ages.

2016-07-15 22:45:14,"Hi I'm new to this site. My daughter has just turned 14 & has had uveitis in both eyes for just over 4 months now. She's been on either Maxidex (which burn her eyes) or Pred Forte steroid drops starting hourly reducing to 6 x daily then reducing by one drop per week or fortnight but each time she's got down to two drops a day the uveitis has flared right back up. Shes also on dilating drops as she's had complications with sticky deposits causing her cornea to stick to her iris & distort her pupil into a figure 8. Now she's been referred to Bristol Eye Hospital for immunosuppressants but I'm worried about the effects of these. However I'm more worried about her deteriorating eye sight.

Until the inflammation is controlled, everything to do with uveitis is so demoralising.",It sounds as though you have already done that really difficult parental weighing up act of deciding which is more important - the fear of beginning an immune suppressant or the fear your child will lose sight.,"Children are generally started on methotrexate as an immune suppressant. At the low doses required for uveitis and with careful monitoring, it's a generally safe treatment. The side effects parents report include their child feeling very tired the day after the weekly pills or the injection. Some children may also experience nausea. Many parents choose Friday evenings to give the drug so that the child has the weekend to get over it. I take my own methotrexate just before going to bed and because it hasn't tired me out or made me feel sick, I assume I sleep through any immediate side effects. On occasion, when I've forgotten to take it before bed and take it in the morning, then I feel a tiny bit off during the day and don't fancy eating at all until the evening. Folic acid is prescribed with mtx to help with side effects.","If Bristol decide your daughter should have methotrexate injections instead of pills, this can cause a problem for some young people but there is a brilliant paediatric uveitis nurse there who will help you and your daughter manage this.",topic_5260163,My 14 year old daughter has had Uveitis for 4 months.

You probably already know from your own research that the most common cause of uveitis in children is JIA and sometimes the uveitis will develop before the JIA. I would certainly talk to the rheumatologist about the symptoms and ask what other rheumatoid condition might be behind them if he agrees that it's definitely not JIA. With Bristol being a referral and research centre, they do tend to see the really rare diseases. It might be helpful to take some photos of your daughter's knees in flare up just in case her knees are not swollen or hot on the day of your appointment. This might provide some clues about what's going on if there's no physical evidence of a problem on the day and the x-rays done so far have shown no damage to the joints, or evidence of JIA activity.","Who knows - Bristol may be able to diagnose an underlying condition to explain the uveitis.

Steroid puts out the inflammation quickly and cells disappear. The redness, if you have it, may disappear in a day or two but that's not to say there are no cells inside the front of the eye which are seen during the slit lamp exam. Treatment means reducing the drops slowly over 6-8 weeks. Reduce the drops too quickly, or stop them suddenly, and rebound inflammation may occur. The iritis, generally, only goes because steroid is going in and the eye has to get used to less and less steroid and then none at all without flaring up again before you can say the iritis has gone.

It's so confusing and when I found this site with it's Glossary I cursed that it hadn't existed all that time ago!,"You're right that synechiae is the same as the sticking you've been told about. Basically (and yes I've stolen this straight from the glossary on this site!) synechiae is like scar tissue which forms after the eye in question has suffered alot of flares.  It can make the iris stick to the cornea and then it's called anterior synechiae, or / and it can make the iris stick to the lens and then it's called posterior synechiae.  But both are to do with Anterior Uveitis.",It's a confusing term but having posterior synechiae does not mean your son has posterior uveitis it just means the sticking part has happened in a different part of the iris but still at the front of the eye - and when uveitis happens around the iris that's part of anterior uveitis.,"The synechiae can ""pull"" the pupil into strange shapes which is why Owen's is square.  The dilating drops can break up the stickiness but from my understanding it's not always successful but it's one of those thing that doesn't cause any harm in trying.

The mydrilate drops have not yet made his left pupil round it is still square, so i have a feeling iots too late for the damage already caused.  If this is the case is there something they can do to reverse the synechiae?  also he has learning diff, lang delay and doesnt ever tell me if he is hurt etc so he hasnt mentioned anything about his vision, i ask him and he doesnt undertstand, how can i get a better idea/picture of how it effects his sight? any ideas.",and thanks so much,sarah,topic_470138,son newly diagnosed with uveitis,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/564680527/,SarahAuger,2011-04-02 17:30:22,"Hi Sarah,",topic_470138,son newly diagnosed with uveitis,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2011-04-02 17:40:18,"thanks so much, he has been wearing glasses for 18 months as he is long sighted, he goes the eye clinic every 6 weeks, they keep an eye(lol) on his right eye as it has a turn in it and my dad has a lazy eye, she does this test with him every time, pointing at a shape and he points to the correct shape on the paper in front of him, only 5 weeks ago at a routine appointment he could get any right and she said his sight had deteriorated amd she order a urgent eye test, so when we came for the eye test, when they put the drops in his pupil went square and thats when we found out about the uveitis.

Wishing you all the best,,,,"Owen may not have noticed anything odd with his sight. Some people with anterior uveitis don't notice anything at all even when inflammation is bad. Others do. It's even more difficult with young children because they assume everyone sees the way they do and so don't say anything until it's obvious to them that others see better. Even then, some may stay quiet because they don't want to wear glasses.","Owen's visual acuity should have been tested by a nurse before he saw the doctor and you should have been told what it was. I think they have a special test for children Owen's age when knowledge of the alphabet cannot be taken for granted. If you weren't told and can't wait for the next appointment, then visiting an optician would give you an answer. Since Owen's eyes are dilated, it would be wise to tell an optician this, because looking through a pin hole compensates for the effect the dilating drops have on sight.","Whether Owen's vision has been affected all along, or whether it hasn't, he will notice a difference in what he sees now. The dilating drops blur vision and in bright light, such as sunlight, you'll notice his pupil doesn't become small like your own. He'll see better in places like underground car parks than he does in places like supermarkets with their artificial light. A pair of polorised sun glasses will be helpful outside.","feel free to call me anytime on the numbers I gave you in the email, you'll find the Helpline number on all the website pages or email me on",,,,,,,,well thanks for reading.,sarah,,,"With the synechiae, if dilating drops don't do the job, then I'm afraid only surgery can break the adhesions.

However, I do know that loss of sight and reduced central vision do affect one's ability to read and suspect that if this occurs when a child is learning to read, there are consequences.","My own uveitis affected my sight and for quite a long time I couldn't read easily, or even at all. Once sight was restored, I found that I read differently. I no longer see spelling mistakes easily and put this down to having spent such a long time struggling to read and guessing words from the odd letters I could make out. I would think that if sight is affected while a child is learning to read, then there  will be an impact on reading and the development of reading skills. While this is not dyslexia, at the very least, a child struggling to see and therefore reading ever so slowly, is not a child who is necessarily going to enjoy reading or even want to read. It's very hard work. As an adult who loves reading, I eventually found it too frustrating and would only attempt to read what was necessary for every day living, like a bill or bank statement.","A friend found me a 'books online' website and I could enlarge text like you can with Kindle etc these days. To the fully sighted, it sounds easy, problem sorted. However, even though you can see huge text, it's still frustrating because the size of the text means only so many words per line and the ability to skim read is lost with this.

Infection is just one of the many causes of uveitis including eg trauma to the eye and auto-immune diseases.  In your case the antibiotics kill the infection and steroid drops take away the inflammation temporarily, but testing positive for HLA-B27 it seems possible that the root of the problem has never been addressed.",However it must also be stressed that although you have certain markers this does not mean that you will ever develop any systemic disease whatsoever.,"At present there is  no ""cure"" for uveitis, just the hope that with the right combination of meds it can be put into successful long term remission.","Despite the longevity of your uveitis you don't mention any vision loss which makes me hopeful that you have suffered several bouts of mild uveitis, which has not caused any complications. You have also illustrated the need to jump into action each time a flare occurs regardless of how many years have passed since the last flare, and ensure you receive a treatment which works for you.",topic_1003846,ANTIBIOTICS,http://www.facebook.com/nicki.davis.1023,Nicki,,Hi Nicki,"Thanks for the kind thoughts (and also to Maxine who also expressed sympathy).  In actual fact when I had my first attack I was given a quite small chance of keeping the sight in my right eye (which was the first affected).  Following the administration of antibiotics I recovered so quickly that I counted myself very lucky.  The next attack I was a bit slow in demanding antibiotics plus the Doctor treating me forgot to sign me up for intensive dilations (I was again an in patient in hospital)so I have some damage where my iris stuck to my lens.  Neither attack was mild and was in fact was extremely severe and rapid but the inflamation was confined, I think, to the front of the eye.  After that I demanded antibiotics at a very early stage and have not suffered any further damage to either eye.","I actually think myself very lucky in that I could have lost my sight some 40 years ago so I have had all that time of normal life which was ""stolen"" from fate; I try to live my life accordingly.  The odd reoccurance now is nothing but a mild nuisance and I feel very reassured with my letter (I have copies everywhere) from my friendly Proffessor saying I need antibiotics when required.",topic_1003846,ANTIBIOTICS,,,2011-11-18 13:32:46,"I think, although, it has never been proven that my uveitis was caused by antibiotics (I am allergic to pretty much every antibiotic known to man). In 1998, I was seriously ill with an infection of my liver and gallbladder and I was on antibotics for several months before and after the operation I had to remove the offending gallbladder.  It was in November of that year that my eyes started to become red and sore, my workplace sent me to Selly Oak casualty who thought I had scratched my cornea.  Needless do say my eyes did not improve and my boss was increasingly distressed about the state of my eyes because he said they made him feel quite sick.  I decided to take myself to the Birmingham & Midland Eye Centre where uveitis was diagnosed and then I found myself in the Eye Hospital on a regular basis.",topic_1003846,ANTIBIOTICS,http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1318985933,DeniseMeredith,,Hi Denise,Sorry it has taken me so long to reply but I have been having real problems with my computer!,It just goes to show one man's meat is another man's poison.

It was very severe and I was hospitalised.  After about 2 weeks or so I could no longer see out of my right eye due to exudate (pus!).  I was treated with steroids and Atropine by the bucket load and the usual conventional treatments, injections in to the eye etc. but all to no avail.  Eventually someone suggested trying antibiotics which worked like magic; within a day or so my vision started to return.  I had several more attacks over the next ten years or so, all following the same pattern.  Each time because of the itinerant nature of hospital Doctors I had enormous difficulty in persuading them to give me antibiotics. Eventually I got a letter to carry around explaining the situation .  It was presumed that I had a bacterial infection, which was not located.  My last attack followed Scarlet Fever, a bacterial infection.  I had several bouts of mouth ulcers prior to my first attack and after each attach I suffered from very severe exhaustion.  May be indicating Bechet's Syndrome? I am Lactose intollerant, again this might be relevant.","I had no more attacks until relatively recently.  I am now 63 years old; I have moved to a different part of the country and in any case my old hospital notes had been destroyed.  Also thinking I was cured I had foolishly thrown out my letter.  The first recent attack was cured very quickly because the hospital Doctor I spoke to believed my story and gave me antibiotics.  The next time the Registrar treated me as an idiot and I walked out.  She would only give me drops and wanted to sign me off for two weeks.  As I knew how much damage could be done in two weeks I went to another casualty department and the Doctor I saw was sympathetic but would not give me antibiotics straight away.  However, he promissed to see me in a couple of days to review the situation.  As it happened I had been having bouts of what I thought was Neuralgia and remembered the investigations into my Dental Health the very first time I had Uvitis (incidentally these all proved to be negative). So I went to the Dentist.  She carried out some X-rays and found that I had an infected tooth under a recently fitted crown, so I got my antibiotics from the Dentist and the Uvitis was also cured.  Subsequently I (very reluctantly) went back to the original hospital at the insistence of my GP.  I saw a Professor (the lady Registrar's boss!) who not only listed to me but actually gave me a new “To whom it may concern” letter.  He was a bit scathing about Doctors who do not listen to their patients. He also said that at one time a standard attempted cure for Uvitis was to remove all the patients teeth!",I'll keep my fingers crossed that the uveitis has now been banished from your life never to return!,Take care,Nicki,,Best Wishes Peter,,"I have had steroids injected into my eye and into my leg, I have been on drips of steroids in hospital too when my eye pressures have gone through the roof.  In 2002, I had my first trabulectomy on my left eye because my pressures had increased to 32 and I was given some pretty awful tablets to take that made my extremeties go numb (this made life difficult because I felt as though my fingers had been substituted for a pound of sausages). I have been taking various drops ever since.","Since then I have had various operations on my eyes - my left eye in particular as that was always the worst myopically.  I no longer have any central vision in my left eye due to glaucoma.  In 2004, I had a headache for a few days that I could not shift and that necessitated a trip to the hospital on my return from a long weekend and the pressure in my right eye had rocketed to 53 - I was not allowed to leave the hospital and ended up on a drip to reduce the pressure to a limit where it was safe to operate.","Although I have not been discharged from the glaucoma clinic, I no longer attend it as my pressures are monitored by the uveitis clinic and my consultant Prof Murray.  In 2009, I had a cataract removed from my left eye and I was hoping that I would get a decent lense but Prof decided to make it short sighted to balance out my other eye which is also short sighted - the op was done for medical reasons as I don't really get any benefit.  My eye pressures have gradually increased too - I was averaging out 4-6 in each eye and now I am back in double figures (10).  My uveitis is under control and I have Minims and take one drop per day to each eye.  I attend clinic every 3 months.","Welcome and glad you found us. When you're next in the eye clinic, have a look around for the blue and pink OV posters - Prof Murray said he put one up! (He treats me too).",,,,,,,,"I have the Gene Marker HLA B27, which I understand is significant.",I think the above information my be of interest to some acute Uvitis sufferers.  It would appear that when triggerd by some bacterial infections my immune system regards parts of my eye as a foreign invader and reacts accordingly.  If I get antibiotics and the usual steroid and Atropine drop treatment very quickly the cure is very successful and speedy.,Peter Stone,UPDATE 15/02/2012,"I tend to get flare ups when I am run down and when I am ill, I then self medicate my eye drops increasing them to 2hourly and then reducing them over several weeks back to one drop per day.  Prof is aware that I do this.  If I get a headache that I can't shift then I take myself to the Eye Casualty to have my pressures checked just in case my eye pressures have risen.",,,Your post on the other forum had me reading my Minims' box. I've been keeping my boxes on a shelf in the dining room. The pharmacist keeps them on a shelf so I didn't think they might need to be in the fridge. Currently debating whether the temperature in here goes over 25 degrees. Thanks for that wake up call to read the boxes these things come in!,Sorry you've had such a horrible time with your uveitis and glaucoma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I was interested in what you said about pressures.  When I was in hospital they occasionally debated about measuring mine but the senior Doctor pointed out my eye was very soft.  If those days all the measuring devices actualy touched the eye.  I had assumed my pressure would be raised on the grounds that sometimes, after injections in the eye, the conjunctiva would bulge out of my closed eye.  But perhps that was just because of the increased liquid content.  I can verify that my eye would be soft during an attack as after my first bout (nobody warned me it might reoccur) I tried contact lenses and got one stuck on my eye.  Yes I know I was very stupid, but I was very young.  On the other hand I do occasionally wear them now for rock climbing.  But I balance the risk of getting one stuck against getting broken lens in my eye after a fall!",,,Anyway enough rambling from me.

I have been under a lot iof stresss lately as my wife has been ill.  I always suspected it was stress related but this has confirmed it.  This time the attack was more like my old ones being preceeded by extreme exhaustion.  I went to Queen Mary's Sidcup and was treated by a terrific Doctor.  He said I had the very early stages and all he could see was the redness and a slighly reduced pressure but, armed with my letter from Prof Stamford, I got antibiotics and steroid drops prescribed with no trouble.  So I am feeling much more cheerful today.  I supose the exhaustion is due to the bacterial infection but is it inside my body (like Shingles) and comes out to get me when I am under stress or is it external and I am more vulnerable then?  And does it matter anyway?  And how can I spell check these posts?",And another thing thing.  I have had Uveitis in my right eye.  I have had it in my left eye.

Let me just make sure I've got this right:,Diagnosed April 2008 bilateral anterior uveitis = steroids,Diagnosed July 2008 intermediate uveitis (and anterior still?)= steroids,Feb 2010 - Azathioprine and steroid,topic_1004027,New member - on going intermediate uveitus,http://www.facebook.com/nicki.davis.1023,Nicki,,Thanks for replying.,Yes you've mainly got the gist of it. I had the anterior uv in the early stages and was given both Pred Forte and Maxidex.  However once I started on the oral steroids in Oct 2008 all drops were stopped and I was told I had classic intermediate uv I've been tld this several times. However they were concerned about inflamation in the back of the eye and I had photographs taken almost every week to monitor it.,"I was taken off the Azath in Aug 2010 because of low bone marrow then they put me back on it Oct 2010 to give it another go. Same thing happened so stopped Azath in Nov 2010 and waited for bloods to recover.  The bone marrow and white blood count took until April 2011 to get back to normal.  At this point the opthamologist decided not to start TAc but to try and taper the steroid dose I was told these things sometimes ""burn themselves out"".  Once I hit 15mg I started having cloudy vision but the opthamolgist couldn't see much activity in the eye so he dropped me to 10mg followed by 10 mg / 5 mg alternative days.  He was reluctant to start Tac and delayed me over the summer period because he was away on holidays. In Sept 11 I had a flare up because the steroids were reduced.",topic_1004027,New member - on going intermediate uveitus,,,,Thanks Maxine for your support.,topic_1004027,New member - on going intermediate uveitus,,,2011-11-13 01:54:41,"Hi Suz,","You are ill.

Braiden has been on steroids for 10 months. He is also autistic and lacks the ability to communicate how much his medical issues are affecting him emotionally. We went to a psychiatrist to seek medication management for his behavior, as he has raging outbursts and long, mournful crying spells. The psych remarked that his emotional/behavioral state was not a psychiatric concern, but an anxiety-based behavioral manifestation due to his delicate physical state. He started no new meds but referred us to a psychology clinic that specializes in treating children with chronic medical problems to help Braiden learn to cope with the anxieties of being a sick child, and a child who is rapidly losing his senses of sight and hearing.","Suz, you are not nuts. You are not going crazy. You have a very serious medical condition that is being treated with high-risk medications that quite frankly, make you feel more ill in order to make you better. It is maddening what UV sufferers go through. As far as I have read, Maxine is right. The fact that you are still working in a high-demand workplace shows tremendous grace and strength on your part. I, as just a parent, could not cope with my workload and had to reduce my hours and withdraw from college in order to meet the demands of helping my child.

He said that's why he has delayed in offering alternative treatment.

It’s put in as a painless injection. The steroid is released slowly over three years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It will be mostly used for intermediate, pan and posterior uveitis. It is helpful if you keep getting macular oedema, or immune suppressants don’t work, or you can’t tolerate them. Sometimes oral steroid and an immune suppressant are used with it. It has a category C pregnancy risk - it has not been tested for safety in pregnancy but steroid is generally considered the safest uveitis drug to use during pregnancy.  If you’ve already needed several Ozurdex implants (a shorter acting steroid implant) this new insert may be an attractive alternative for you. The main side effects are cataract and raised eye pressure. Raised pressure affects about 34% of Iluvien recipients but this can, mostly, be controlled with pressure lowering drops.","Olivia’s Vision is nominating Alison Richards as our patient expert because she has had a very hard time with her uveitis and Iluvien has changed her life. We are also nominating Archana Pradeep as our clinical expert, the uveitis consultant in Nottingham, who is one of our former, successful OV Uveitis Fellowship trainees.","Our two experts, and OV, want to give NICE a full picture of the difference Iluvien will make to the vision of people with uveitis and to the quality of life of those with the disease and people close to them.

2017-03-24 02:16:01,Hi I am posting for a friend.  She has a child who has been diagnosed with Blaus Syndrome. The symptoms from this are Uveitis and Juvenile Arthritis. Her daughter has been prescribed a drug called Humira which is a fortnightly injection.  My friend would like to make contact with any parent whose child may be taking this medication or has any of the above symptoms or syndrome. She is wanting to know what side effects the drug may be having on the child as well as just to talk to someone who knows what her and her daughter are going through and if there are any other avenues of treatment.  Please PM me or leave a comment if you can assist and I will get in touch with you. Thank you.,topic_5402532,Humira Injections - Side effects,https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10154570682061902/,HeidiClarke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2011-05-11 22:17:11,"My daughter was diagnosed with Anterior Uveitis nearly 3 years ago at the age of 10, in her right eye. At that time we were in the process of emigrating to france, and over night our plans changed due to this diagnosis. Since then, we have been through a long process of trying to keep the Uveitus at bay, with very little progress. Ellys Uveitus is Idiopathic, so she has no related inflammatory disease, but now 3 years on, she is still on Maxidex, and has a partial stuck pupil to the cornea that can never be corrected! I feel some hospitals have failed us in some way. The first hospital, took her off the dilation and maxidex drops too quickly to see how her eye would respond without them, and hence thats why her pupil stuck. From there, i then decided to move to another consultant, and to another hospital, and we are still no further in getting her off those awful drops. 5 weeks ago, the consultant told me to take her off the drops again, to see how her eye responds without them, but an appointment last week confirmed, that the eye started to inflame again, and started to get get active cells...we are now back on the maxidex drops!!! I feel that sometimes i dont get any answers from any of these consultants, they tell me that she could have this for the next 10 years, but avoid telling me what damage and the long term effects that the drops will give her. A decision has been made to now seek a second opinion and we have an appointment booked with Professor Ayliffe in 2 weeks to see if she can be offered any other treatment. I feel that she is 13 now,next year she picks her GCSE's, and coming up to some of the most important and crucial years of her life. My fear is that this can come in her other eye too, but every time i ask this, they cannot give me any answers, which i know, but this doesnt make this any easier. My husband has a very different approach to me, sometimes i think he buries his head in the sand, has only been to a few appointments with me, not because he isnt a great dad, which he is, and loves Elly very much, but just doesnt get the seriousness of this. I have insisted that he comes with me to see Professor Ayliffe, hopefully he will tell it straight, not beat around the bush, and maybe then my husband, will understand. I know Elly is lucky that she only has this in one eye, and she is currently well (apart from bad hypermobility, where she was treated at Gosh for at their clinic) and to look at her you would never know that anything was wrong. This doesnt stop the pain and suffering we go through as parents, and as a mother.....you just want it to go away, and know their future will be as best as you can hope for.",topic_572501,New Member - Daughter with Anterior Uveitis....,http://www.facebook.com/596037200,NatalieAdamsNeeMeerkin,2011-05-11 22:55:09,"Hi Natalie,","Sorry you can't get Elly off the drops and the consultants are reluctant to give you straight answers.

2011-07-12 10:44:31,"Hi, I was told last week at our 3 month eye check, that the surface of my daughter's eyes are very dry, and it may be due to blepharitis,(inflammation of the eyelids interfering with the tear production). I had not imagined inflammation affecting these, he said to use a lubricating eye drop if it continues to feel uncomfortable, which I will buy today as she is saying it feels like there is something in her eye now, and I can't see anything. Last week at Gosh for her JIA infusion the reg said he would ask their opthalmologist to see her when we go again in 4 weeks or 8 weeks. Does anyone else have any experience of this ??

Not only with doctors and nurses there have been teachers,social services,the council(obtaining a blue badge),not to mention the endless forms for DLA.This condition is draining emotionally and at times can be overwhelming without having to fight for support in school etc. Never give up if you think you are entitled to something and never hesitate to ask for more info or to question your doc/consults course of action.We have done the eye drops to the point where i had to put a chart on the wall for each eye to keep track of them and thankfully are well past the days when i had to pin her to the floor to give her them,where ever we were including the middle of sainsburys! She has had 2 surgery's for the glaucoma about 4yrs ago and it now seems well controlled,she has had numerous steroid injections to her joints and currently she is taking methotrexate by wkly injection,folic acid tabs and nurofen when needed. At the moment everything seems fairly settled so the methotrexate seems to be working. One area where i think there isn't much support is the impact this has not only on the parent but also the child.I know i've gone from mother on a mission on the way to appointments to a crumbling heap once i've put her to bed. I've sat and listened to my daughter at the age of 7 or 8 asking me if this condition will kill her, will she be able to have children and will she go blind my heart would break knowing these are things she has thought about. Outwardly she copes very well with her condition but i know there are a lot of emotions going on inside its a constant battle for our kids too,from putting up with treatments,endless appointments to teasing in school and trying to fit in which i think most kids of her age find difficult enough without all the extras! This is why i think this site is so fantastic not only has it given me the chance to talk to other parents but it has enabled Tanisha to find Olivia, tho they haven't spoken as yet she is so excited to be able to meet someone the same age as her who shares the same battles. I'm hoping they will become good friends and can offer some support to each other in between chatting about Justin Bieber lol.",I could go on all night,Thanks,Amanda,,"As an adult who has gone through what your daughters have experienced, I'm just left heart broken.

This effusion was confirmed by ultrasound a few days later. We were repeatedly told it was most likely a post-infectious inflammation and it would go away. This hasn't happened and almost all of her joints are now painful.","At the same time as the joint pains, she complained of stinging eyes and shapes in front of her eyes. Rheumatology told us to take her to an optician, who did various checks and said she was fine and it was just normal floaters, but made an opthamology referral anyway. She had her initial appointment last Friday, and she has bilateral chronic uveitis, which so far is quite mild and has not damaged her sight.","She was reviewed by the opthamologist at the rheumatology clinic on Thursday, and they no longer think it is juvenile arthritis, which was the focus of their initial investigations, but a systemic inflammatory condition. She had loads more blood tests taken, a chest x-ray, and she will have an ECG in two weeks.","Since the first opthamology appointment six days before, her uveitis had worsened in her left eye (it was initially worse in the right eye).

My vision was blurry too. I was put on pred forte for about 2 months without any improvement. I sought another doctor for a second opinion and I was told to have intermediate uveitis as well as anterior uveitis in both eyes. I had done all the required investigations and all were negative. I was advised to have steroid injections in my eyes. I was asymptomatic at that time so I refused the injections. After a short while I came to the UK to study a master’s degree. I had another flare up of my uveitis and I was referred to Moorfield's eye hospital by my GP. I was put on Maxidex eye drops and was told that I don't need the injections anymore. I was also diagnosed with chronic retinal vasculitis which I didn't need treatment for because it was not active.  In the past year I have had 5 flare ups of my anterior uveitis and was on and off the maxidex and the dilating drops. I consider myself lucky because I don't usually have any symptoms when I flare up except for one time where I had floaters, but it's also a disadvantage because the inflammation can get really bad without me noticing. That’s why I have frequent follow ups more than other patients.",I had a follow up appointment last week where my doctor suspected my retinal vasculitis to be active again. I had a fluorescein angiogram done and it showed that my vessels are inflamed and leaking. The doctor prescribed me oral steroids for the first time but she suggested I get investigated for TB and sarcaidosis before starting on the steroids- although she's suspecting it to be idiopathic but just in case. I started developing floaters and my vision is a bit blurry but the blurriness improves when I wear my glasses.,I'm going back again tomorrow to know the results and get my steroid prescription.,I'm so glad that I have done my master’s degree before all of this have started.

I fortunately live near one of the country's leading eye infirmary's and was referred to the A & E department by my Optician after he had examined me.  This was where I was first diagnosed, my Iris had stuck to the eye lens and has left a scar to this day.  I was immediately started on Pred Forte  and 2 hourly mydriatic drops.  I had to return after a few days to have the inflammation cells counted.

To avoid contamination, be careful not to touch the dropper or top of the ointment tube or let it touch your eye. Always replace the cap tightly after each use. Tilt your head back, look up, and pull down the lower eyelid to make a pouch. For drops/gels, place the dropper directly over the eye and squeeze out 1 or 2 drops as needed. Look down and gently close your eye for 1 or 2 minutes. Place one finger at the corner of the eye near the nose and apply gentle pressure. This will prevent the medication from draining away from the eye. For an ointment, hold the tube directly over the eye and gently squeeze a small strip (one-fourth of an inch or roughly 6 millimeters) of ointment into the pouch. Release the eyelid, close the eye, and slowly roll your eye in all directions to spread the medication.

Currently she is on quite a lot of steroid drops a day - pred forte 6 x day, cyclopetalate 2 x day and maxitrol 1 x day. she had been on this regime for around 10 weeks now with no reduction.

They must see lots of glaucoma patients who have to change glaucoma drops because of side effects. When there is an obvious problem with glaucoma eye drops getting into the blood stream, why should steroid drops be any different as far as side effects go?",You have my sympathy. It's a pity that the non steroidal anti inflammatory drops aren't much good for uveitis.,Thanks so much for your reply. I got a call back from the drug info line at Moorfields and they said it could be the Mydrilate as it can cause psychological effects and told me to go to Moorfields A&E - They also thought it would be unlikely to be the Maxidex.,"Just got back and they've told me to stop the Mydrilate and Maxidex. Starting Lotemax tomorrow. The Uveitis is very mild so I don't need the dilation. The doctor also said he thought it unlikely to be the Maxidex but I did mention that maybe I'm hyper sensitive and he agreed it could be a possibility. He also mentioned that next time I get a flare I could try something that is non steroidal, similar to Ibuprofen. I'l definitely give it a go.","Another bit of information I found out is, the dilation drops they use to examine have the same or a similar ingredient to sudafed which I've also had a bad time on.",Hope the Lotemax is giving you a calmer day! Your information about mydrilate made me shiver - used that for about 18 months.,"It was a preventative measure for one eye since immunosuppressants were not fully stopping the inflammation and the pupil stuck at one point. Mydrilate three times a day for a week bounced it free, so continued twice a day until cataract surgery.","I definitely have had side effects with maxidex when I had to put them in every 2 hours recently.  Not so bad during the day but at night my heart was racing and I could not sleep and felt agitated but I knew it was the drops as I have taken oral steroids before with the same effect although more severe.  If you press the inside of your nose when you put the drops in, it definitely helps as it does not enter your system as severely.   Some of the consultants will dismiss it at Moorfields but I have to say mine does agree it certainly can have this effect given it is basically entering your system.  I don't use any other drops so I knew it was absolutely this and it went away when I stopped the drops.  I think when you don't know what is causing it the anxiety of not knowing what it is definitely makes it worse I found, still annoying though trying to get to sleep when your heart keeps racing.",,,"I have had non steroidal drops like Acular but unfortunately they alone were not strong enough to do very much for me although they did not cause side effects.

I'm scared I have a form of Psychosis or that it could develope into that. I suppose I should go back and try the other drops but I don't want that not to work and then have to start the steroids from scratch,Howard,"I completely sympathise with this as I absolutely hate all forms of steroids both drops and oral because of the ghastly side effects I too have esperienced.  If you can hang on in there until the flare has calmed down it would be better as the options if non steroidal drops don't work are systemic drugs.  I am not sure if you have uveitis in both eyes, if so of course you have double the amount going in your system.  I have it in one eye but 6 drops a day was enough to keep me up all night with heart beating fast and give me anxiety.  You may find by tomorrow with lotemax which is really not as strong it will calm down.  I wish I could be more helpful but if it gets you through a flare without having to take systemic drugs try to get through it as this in my opinion is better,  so long as you do not take the drops for too long.",,"I'm sorry to hear that you get this too but it's also a relief to find I'm not making it up in my head haha Touch wood, when I get flares it's in one eye and not both. I actually feel a little bit more together at the moment. I have a follow up at moorfields on Friday so I think I will stick to the Lotemax and see how it goes unless the symptoms get worse. I nearly threw the towel in this morning as I still felt awful and in ways worse but then things got a little clearer and then I thought that maybe it could have been the other drugs leaving my system and having a last effect?",So hard to know.

Because the inside of the eye is effectively a closed vessel this pressure buildup can reduce the flow of blood to the retina and the optic nerve entering the eye.,In this instance it is likely that the cause is the use of corticosteroid treatment. They can give you drops to control the pressure. It should not pose a serious problem.,I have had a genetic form of glaucoma since I was 40 and been on treatment for 20 years and suffered no eye damage at all in this time. Even though I have been on corticosteroid drops for 8 months the pressures have remained good. The treatments are very good and they should control the pressures adequately.,Hope this reassures you.,topic_608374,confussed,,,2011-05-26 16:40:27,"Hi Caron,","With what you have written about Jack's treatments, the secondary glaucoma is probably Jack's high eye pressure which is already being treated by the xalatan and the other glaucoma drop you've mentioned.",There is a difference between high ocular pressure and glaucoma.

2011-07-14 09:24:57,Hi  I was wondering if anyone here has any good recommendations for  booklets/articles on immunosuppressant and lifestyle changes  - not actual information on immunosuppressant medicines but lifestyle information: precautions to take; what to do/not to do; how the body copes with everyday infections when it is immunosuppressed.

2012-07-24 20:50:14,"Hi, I wanted to introduce myself and maybe see if anyone can give me any info? By the way thank goodness for sites like yours i don't know what i would do without the info you provide. I'm 30 yrs old and I was diagnosed with Iritis in febuary. It came on all of a sudden and id never even heard of it. I'm currently on my 6th flare up since feb, this doesn't include every time i have one it goes over to the other eye. Each time i have either just maxidex (1st time Predforte) or maxidex and the dilating drops. The last time i had a flare up i was in so much pain i went to a normal A&E as our Eye Hospital A&E here in B'ham closes at 7pm and i begged them to give me pain relief in tears as they didn't stock steroid eye drops and it was late at night, they couldn't help. I had to wait until the next morning to get help! Worst night of my life! I've had blood tests for everything they say is connected and they cant find any underlying cause as to why I have this and so suddenly also it just wont go. Other than this im mostly healthy apart from IBS. The most i've been all clear with Iritis is about 3 weeks since feb. Its really upsetting me now, so what i'm wondering is do you know of anything I can do? Any suggestions at all! Any treatment, anyone i can see? I surely cant have this constant? My husband and I also want to start a family but I'm worried about the medication. This is all really new to me and reading a few things on this website has helped because the doctors cant seem to answer my questions so i'm hoping for help here?

I think the majority of cases do not have a cause. People may be able to give you some advice about asking for anti-TNF drugs which can be used in some long term cases. These are a problem though if trying for a baby as they do not like you being on them due to them being a relatively new drug and not knowing the long term effects on pregnancy. I think steroid drops in the eyes are good for not getting into the blood stream so are ok.,"Coming from a someone that had uveitis related to AS, I have also read quite a lot about the other related auto-immune diseases. Mild Crohns can sometimes be mistaken for IBS and there are cases of people developing Uveitis that suffer from Chrohn's so it might be worth mentioning your IBS to the Dr and seeing if they think there could be a connection? Just a thought.",I was given 3 bottles of steroid drops and one bottle of dilating on my first prescription. So I had a spare bottle of unopend steriod drops at the end of treatment when I was clear 2 1/2 months later. I keep them stored just incase (it is important they are unopened). Maybe it would be worth asking them to prescribe an extra bottle next time you go explaining your reason? I think with your eyes flaring they will be happy to do this for you and means you will not be in pain if it flares at the wrong time.,I'm sure someone who knows more will be along to offer some advice soon x,topic_1787886,Recurring Iritis with no known cause.,http://www.facebook.com/eve.ellison,EveEllison,2012-07-25 18:21:47,Thanks so much for your advise.

It is possible to get a false negative reading with Celiac tests. i.e one could be Celiac yet still test negative for it.

The reason I went back was because of the increase in debris. I went through A&E. For some reason if you go through A&E there is no record in the eye unit of the consult which I presume is held in A&E. The registrar went and spoke to the consultant on duty. He said to me that the recurring uveitis is part of the continuing systemic disease. He wants me seen by the Rheumatologist. The Rheumatologist discharged me in  January, back to internal medicine as he said there was no clear indication of the cause. He suggested I saw someone in the renal unit. The registrar was very concerned that no followup work is being done. It took 6 weeks to get an appointment with the rheumatologist when I was really ill with kidney failure.

Since you've had injections for posterior uveitis, believe it or not, you're already a pro in terms of eye procedures. I once sat in a waiting room of post op patients who were discussing their cataract ops. They all agreed that the scariest thing was the injection of anaesthetic before the op. and all of them were chuffed at the sight they regained.","The risks of post op inflammation and cystoid macular oedema make the use of steroid necessary. I imagine the dose of steroid will slowly decrease over the ten week period, so the side effects will lessen. You could ask if it's possible to get your steroid through iv just before the op. Having it that way means you don't get fat, but you still get other side effects, like insomnia. I've had it through iv and felt euphoric for about 36 hours, then depressed and nauseous (perhaps that's why you don't get fat when it comes through iv?).

You can try a simple elimination diet or have IGg blood tests carried out (YorkTest is the most common in the UK).

2012-09-14 15:41:57,"Hi, some advice please! Harrison just had a big flare up and it was controlled by Maxidex although his eye pressure went up to 33. He moved back to Vexol which just is not controlling the inflamation. He has now been put on Pred forte.  Maxidex seems to put the eye pressure up and making the cateracts worsen. Any info about Pred Forte is most welcome.  I have no idea about it.  His pressure is now normal but inflammation about 1 on the scale.  Not bad but only 2 weeks since last appt so hoping the Pred Forte means he doesnt have to go back on Maxidex.  Any info greatly recieved xxxx",topic_1910671,Harrison - pred forte,http://www.facebook.com/100000503252701,TanyaLloyd,2012-09-14 17:08:54,"Hi Tanya,",Glad the flare was brought under control and sorry you've had a pressure scare.,"Pred and Maxidex are about equal in strength and both can raise pressure. Steroid drops, used long enough, will cause cataract. In uveitis, the cataracts tend to be posterior ones and can take quite some time to develop to the point they affect sight. Some patients have them developing for several years before they require surgery, but for others, sight may be affected sooner. I would be inclined to ask Harrison's consultant for information about cataract surgery if the plan is to keep him on drops.","When you go back, if you are still using a lot of drops and pressure is raised again, you could ask about the intermediate strength eye drops, like Predsol - halfway between Vexol and Maxidex/Pred. Using these would, of course, depend on the degree of inflammation. There is also Lotemax which is not supposed to raise pressure, but may not control the inflammation as well as Maxidex and Pred do.","It's quite a balancing act managing steroid drops, pressure rises and glaucoma drops. Has Harrison managed to get off the steroid drops for any length of time so far?",topic_1910671,Harrison - pred forte,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2012-09-14 18:31:43,"Maxine, its been a really hard journey.

Another flare up made him go back on Maxidex every 2 and a half hours and the pressure went up. With then quiet eyes (as the Maxidex sorted it) he went back on Vexol....pressure good, inflammation not so they have decided on Pred Forte.

I was a bit cross with one of the consultants who had told me that Predforte was weaker than Maxidex.  We saw a different one two weeks later who told me truthfully that it just penetrates the eyes better.  Harrison's eyes were almost quiet and the pressure was fine.  We then went back again 2 weeks later and he was moved back to Maxidex and told to come back in 4 weeks with a regime to reduce the Maxidex.,We only lasted 7 days and ended up back at Moorfields A and E as Harrison's near and far vision were awful and he was in pain.,A and E upped his Maxidex to 4 times a day and after two weeks to go to three times a day.

2012-03-14 14:30:40,Harrison was doing really well a few weeks ago.  His eyes were completely quiet but pressure was up so they took him off Maxidex and put him on Vexol.  We ended up at A&E 2 weeks later as he became in pain.  He had an eye lid infection but they found his left eye was flaring.

I have followed my instinct and decided to stick with what she's on for another 6 weeks.,,,,,Here are the Cells and Flare definitions form the Glossary in the Resources section found at the top of each page on this website:,Flare,Fingers crossed that in six weeks' time you know this is the magic bullet for O and she's become more used to it - if that's ever possible for a child putting up with this.,"Best of luck with the next injection,",Maxine,"I give the Humira on a Saturday evening simply because it's easier. It's still taking a couple of hours to get her to have it, and this way I don't have to worry about how late it's getting ...",,,,,,,,"O has been amazing with the actual shot itself which is incredibly painful, but once it's done and she has a quick scream she just gets on with it!  Fortunately so far she's had no ill effects, including no red, sore lump at sight of injection, and bloods all fine.",Take care,Nicki,,,,,"After the first shot which was given in the morning, she slept for four hours but it's not happened since, and I think it was just the stress of the situation.",On the weeks when she has mtx and Humira I give the mtx on the Friday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sam. x,"When blood vessels in the iris leak protein into the anterior chamber flare is said to be present.  Like cells, it is measured on a scale from 0-4.  If permanent change to the blood vessels occurs, the flare is considered chronic, and can be present regardless of whether or not a uveitis ‘flare up’ is occurring.  Flare in the vitreous can also be observed and rated.",Cells and the grading of cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We use the epi pen which is OK, but having used a syringe for mtx for so long I'm only just getting used to it myself. It's quite unwieldy, not designed for small hands!",Take care,Nicki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leukocytes (white blood cells) can be seen during a slit lamp examination.  The cells are a byproduct of inflammation caused by the uveitis.  If the uveitis is anterior, cells can be seen and counted in the fluid in the front chamber of the eye (aqueous humor).  Once dilated, the presence of cells can also be observed in the middle chamber of the eye (the vitreous).","How many cells there are forms the basis of how severe the inflammation is at a particular given time.  The inflammation, and in turn the uveitis, is graded from 1-4, the least severe being 1 (the aqueous calls numbering 6-15) and the most severe inflammation being 4+ (when cells numbers are greater than 60).",So for O the cells have decreased but the flare has worsened as the blood vessels are still leaking protein...,With regards to the Humira:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The first shot of Humira was fine because ignorance is bliss! It's the second which was the worst and took 2 hours to do, the third took 1 and half hours, so a slight improvement.  We just use an ice pack on the stomach for 5 mins or so beforehand (in O's case this means it has gone on and off 10 times or so in the lead up to actually having the shot). None of the creams have ever worked on O and we just use deep freeze from the can for Mtx.  We were advised not to use this for the Humira shot as this can actually make it more painful.",,,,,,,,"As soon as shot is done we put the ice pack back on the site and hold firmly for as long as O feels she needs up - so far a good five minutes, but then that's it, over and done with for another 2 weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Feel free to ask as many questions as you like and I'll try to answer them as honestly as I can.,Take care,Nicki x,,,,

2017-02-10 14:37:14,"I have just had my second episode of Uveitis.  The first flare-up in 2014 was Intermediate uveitis and this time was iritis.  I was given the same steroid drops as I had been prescribed before, Maxidex.   I had to stop taking them half-way through the course, I rang the pharmacist and said that my light sensitivity was worsening   since using the drops.   She said to stop taking them and when I had my next appointment at the uveitis clinic to tell them.  I was diagnosed at the clinic as having Sjogren's syndrome, which they think my dry eyes could be associated with and I have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( a connective tissue disorder which is associated with the retinal changes).  It is the light sensitivity that I am having terrible problems with.  I get glare from every reflective surface,  both outdoors and indoors.  When the sun is low in the sky, as it is this time of year,  I have to walk looking at the ground as I cannot look straight ahead or  upwards as the dazzling glare is unbearable.

All I know is that people who have had their iris damaged by herpetic uveitis sometimes do well with a special contact lens which stops too much light entering the eye. Whether or not something like that would be helpful when you also have dry eye is another matter.,Have you ever been offered Minims steroid drops when you're flaring?

2018-02-01 09:23:27,"My 4 year old is on methotrexate (about 9 months) and started Enbrel 2 months ago.  Her uveitis has been inactive for about a year.  I was alarmed to read on FB forums that Enbrel can cause the uveitis to flare.  I brought this up with the team at GOSH and they said that the research on this was inconclusive and they felt that whilst Enbrel would not help uveitis, neither would it trigger it.  They have now put the ball in my court and said if I am concerned we could switch to Humira but they don’t like to put small ones on it if possible as it’s really stingy.  I thought I had read somewhere that they had taken the preservative part out that stings?  So ... my question is.. what to do?  Do I keep her on Enbrel or switch her?

If she has JIA as well as uveitis, Humira is effective for that and the sting was taken out over a year or two ago, so there shouldn't be old, stingy stock still going out now. I do know of one mother whose daughter did fine on Enbrel for her uveitis and JIA, but you're right, there are reports that uveitis is sometimes triggered. Sorry, don't know how quickly that would happen or whether or not the methotrexate would prevent it from happening. If your daughter has been ok for two months now, maybe she would be OK staying on it. Sorry - I don't have enough knowledge to tell you that for sure though. In your position, going with Mum's instinct, worried by what you've read about Enbrel, I think I'd probably switch to Humira which now has masses of successful clinical trials behind it for JIA uveitis.

This helps to prevent sticking of the pupil. You could ask if using such a drop will prevent further sticking. Once stuck, the pupil is unstuck during cataract surgery.

Although they use a machine as well as manual tests,  if you have little sight left it is not so accurate I believe,  although for me that was not the only problem but someone decided to change the lens just before the op!  I then had laser a year later to correct it.  It is fine now and I see well but I am mad as they do cut your eye for laser and this should never have happened, so I now have very dry eyes from the laser.  I am on Humira and my eye has been quiet for 18 months except for a brief 2 weeks when I had cataract surgery which is normal even if you do not have uveitis.  By the time I had surgery I could not see, everything was just white.  The reason that they did not do it sooner (which would have happened) was because they could not get rid of the CMO until I went on Humira - so it ended up being a year of hardly seeing in one eye and by the end really seeing nothing.  I did not get halos everything just went blurred bit by bit until I could no longer read the eye chart or see faces.  If you no longer have inflammation and do not use steroids it may be that it just stays at the same level for you, but you should be able to tell from the eye chart how much it decreases.  I guess it probably depends on age too as to how how quickly it worsens.

Just don't know how this can last...,(sorry for the rambling :s...),,These posts provide me valuable information on health issues. I don’t have any knowledge about this topic. You should contact the expert. I am sorry for that.,"Thanks a lot for your email. Your situation sounds a bit like mine, except that I don't need surgery yet. If you don't mind, may I ask about your condition and IOP progress up to now?","I got uveitis 4 years ago in one eye.  For almost two years I was given steroid drops and had steroid injections to control the inflammation which included CMO.  I had raised IOP becuause of the steroid drops and also steroid injections (orbital floor dexamethodone).  I then had to have glaucoma drops to keep pressure down which had soared from the steroids.  I ended up after a year with early posterior subcapsular lens opacity from chronic steroid usage.  This progressed fast although you don't wake up one morning with sight gone it increases bit by bit.  However, it is different for everyone the speed at which it progresses but because it is a posterior cataract caused by steroid use or possibly some of it inflammation it tends to be right in the line of vision unlike cataracts from old age hence it effects the vision in a worse way.  In terms of the IOP as soon as I came of steroid drops when the inflammation was controlled with immunossuppresants it dropped back to normal.  I had a cataract operation in February last year.  Again the problem with this is they cannot do the operation if you have any sort of inflammation, ie you have to have a quiet eye for at least four months.  As a result I suffered with a cataract for a year whereby I saw little, as they could not get my inflammation under control.  To make matters worse, I was particularly unlucky as they managed to put the wrong lens in my eye when they did the cataract op.  So whilst it went well I ended up being so shortsighted in just one eye (my other eye is longsighted) that I had to have my eye lasered!  It is now ok but the trauma it went through was so unnecessary.  In the light of all of this, I wish I had been put on immunossuppresants earlier and avoided getting the cataract to start with.   Some Opthamologist will argue the cataract is from inflammation but I do not accept that and think that it is mainly from the steroids either as drops but also orally (although to a lesser degree).  I think your choice to go on immunosuppressants is a good one and hopefully you get your inflammation under control so you do not need steroid drops.  I am assuming you have raised IOP from steroid drops and not from the type of uveitis you have, ie viral?  which immunosuppressants are you on?  If they are not controlling it they may put you on two different types.  Is your uveitis in both eyes?",,,,,,Thank you very much in advance.,"Cheers,",Oki,,,,,………………………………………………., WATER FILTER REVIEWS AND INFORMATION ,,"Also do you have any knowledge on posterior subcapsular cataract? Will the sight get cloudy gradually, or will we maintain sight for a long time then everything just suddenly cracks one day?","So far things are still fine with the immunosuppressant, apart from the cost. So far I can still afford but not sure how it can go up in the future. I have my next checkup soon so just finger cross.","Cheers,",Oki,,,,Can't believe you got the wrong lens!! How is your eye now? Which immunosuppressant are you using?,"The high IOP is linked with uveitis, though I also respond to steroid which worsens the case. My uveitis is unilateral and being treated by cyclosporine. So far I can still see fine, only realising the cataract by big halos around light. When you need surgery does that mean everything is blur and you can't see anything? I don't want to stop work during the wait for surgery!","Cheers,",Oki,,,,"Just wondering whether you know anything about low white blood cells? In my last test just 1 week ago, the white blood was on the verge of the lower normal limit. For the last few days I start to feel tired, sleepy, have occasional muscle pain, nasal drain... Normally they may be symptoms of a cold or sorethroat, but the strange thing is I have no fever or significant pain, just this general tiredness.","So I'm just thinking... is there any chance that when your white blood is too low, your body just wouldn't bother fighting infection and thus you have no fever?? When will it be alarming enough to go to A&E? Last week I had some intense activities and I'm not even sure whether they are the reasons for this or the immunosurpressants :s","The immunosuppressants will lower your white blood cell count to the lowest count to stop your bodies inflammatory response to infection hence preventing the eye inflammation.  They monitor that they do not squash your immune system too much hence keeping it at a level low enough to stop your body inflamming your eye in response to what it thinks is an antigen but not so much that you could not fight an infection if necessary.  Mine too was always at the lowest limit of normal.  At the start the drugs can make you feel tired, you can get muscle pain but often this goes as you get used to the drugs.  The only thing I did find strange was that in all my time on immunosuppressants I never got a cold even when my daughter got a bad one, so I did also wonder sometimes if there was a correlation between this and a lowered immune system.",,"Hope you're feeling better by now! There's been a nasty virus going round - I was in bed for a week with it. I found adjusting to methotrexate quite hard at first - very tired, completely drained - and then I got used to it. But yes the idea is that your white cells are low - and that's what they monitor, whoever is checking your bloods will let you know if there's something unexpected. If you're tired - just rest! Listen to the signals your body is giving you!","Re posterior subcapsular cataract: I've had one since before I started immunosuppressants, although only found out when I saw the consultant... Mine essentially hasn't changed (in 8 years) as we've drastically reduced the amount of steroid I've needed over the years - THAT is why I chose this steroid-sparing treatment approach.","Tatiana - so sorry to hear about your surgery!!! I'd be furious too. Wanted to comment on the dry eyes: my consultant recommended Hylo Tears (by Scope) when I was complaining about blurred vision once. The clinic I had laser surgery at since gave me Hylo Forte (Same company, ""thicker"") - I now buy this on Amazon. Expensive, but no comparison at all to something like Blink or other lubricating drops. I generally use Hylo Forte first thing in the morning/last thing at night and it makes a huge difference.

I not heard of Omega Eye before but good omega supplements make a lot of sense here - I hope that, somehow, anyhow!, you get some relief soon!","Yes, my surgery was purely elective: I was at approx -5.5 with astigmatism in both eyes, and couldn't find contacts that fit properly anymore. Last January's rain really annoyed me with glasses and a friend asked why I didn't consider surgery - I honestly had thought it was out of the question with my uveitis history. Anyway, at my next appointment with Prof Ayliffe I asked his opinion, expecting it to be ruled out and that would be that... But no, he said as long as I saw Prof Reinstein at London Vision Clinic it should be fine - and wrote a referral letter straight away! It's likely my eyes will worsen again with age, but we thought it was safer whilst I was on Humira - and even with some changes, I'd still be much better off that before. So that's what happened, and I honestly cannot recommend LVC enough. Despite perioperative oral steroid for my keyhole(!) laser surgery, I had an unexpected autoimmune scleritis flare 4 days post surgery, but the care I received was superb and with input from both Prof Ayliffe & Reinstein I have no permanent effect from that. It was so unusual they're considering publishing it!

2015-02-27 13:29:55,"Hi Harrison has had chronic bilateral uveitis since the age of 3 and had cateract surgery aged 6.  Now at almost 8 he is to start Methotrexate.  Can anyone give me some advice?  Are there any ways to help him take the pills? Do they taste of anything ie bitter and going to make him gag? What if any side effects have your children experienced and do you have any ways that you have helped your child cope. Are having injections better or more traumatic? I know the side effects are endless and he will have to take folic acid tablets but can I help with diet?

One day after his 7 birthday.  He has it as an oral solution and is on 15mg/week. He was sick once the fist morning after his first dose the evening before. He usually has a hot chocolate first thing. We stopped that, since then he has been absolutely fine no side effetcs. We did have to change the brand of MTX he was having and he was sick once again the next morning but it was after he had hot chocolate first thing, my husband forgot.  He was fine for breakfast at 9 ish and then went to a kids party at 11am. I was a bit worried for him so stayed (something I stopped doing ages ago) but he was absolutely fine. Ate all sorts and was bopping about with the best of them. My worries with regard to MTX with regard to nausea and tiredness just haven't happened.","We give him MTX on Sat evening at 4pm - I figured if he was going to feel poorly it would be better to feel rubbish on Sunday, rather than Saturday. The monthly blood tests are a bit tough but we are getting there slowly.","I wonder, if you mind writing to me about your son's cataract experience? I had looked back ages ago now at old posts and wondered about your son. He is a similar age to Riley.  Riley has a small cataract and I was really keen to contact a parent who had gone through cateract surgery. For advice and tips really.","Anyway, I did worry lots, I still worry lots but so far, MTX hasn't proved to be horrendous, I just keep a close eye on his blood test results and make sure that I take a copy of results every time we go to the hospital. But fingers crossed, It is going OK. I just hope MTX will do the job and keep the uveitis at bay. He recently had a small flare but had only been taking it for 3 months ...

The hospital prescribed MTX solution then asked our GP to take over the prescription. Initially, the GP refused to prescribed the solution as it is more costly than the pills, but I just went in and ""begged"" really, said he couldn't swallow, was worried that we just wouldn't get them in him and I didn't need the added stress beyond giving him MTX and they capitulated.",Not sure that was the best way to go about things but at the moment I am much happier squirting the stuff in Riley's mouth.

He is a steroid responder but the left eye's cataract was fast growing and aged 6 he could not see much out of the left eye.  His eyes had to be quiet for the op first and then he wore an eye guard for some time, especially at night.  His prescription for his glasses took some time to get changed.  For some reason the hospital wanted to wait.  After surgery Harrison was on Maxidex every two hours and then it reduced.  He does have some issues around the new lens inserted in his eye but its not causing him any issues at the moment so we are leaving it be.  Apparently that issue can be corrected with laser surgery.  The cataract in his right eye is much slower growing so we are not there yet for that one.  Thank goodness because my nerves are shattered!!

I am not sure but I think that some of the immunosuppresants are safer to be on if you are wanting  to start a family - I had happened to look at this once when a friend of mine was in the same position because she  was on similar drugs for Lupus (autoimmune illness).  Although I know Ciclosporin is not one of these as I was told when I took it under no circumstances to get pregnant on this, although this was not on my agenda.  Of course I assume none are great and one would never want to take risks however, I have read there are some people who are on these drugs long term and do manage to have families safely.  I would have thought that rheumotologists may be better informed on this in some ways, I would definitely go all out to quiz on this next time you are at hospital.

I attend my hospital every two weeks and in some cases have to go more often than that only to be told I should lower or higher my doses on the six different eye drops I am using (oral steroids effected me badly so I had to stop taking them) it is a vicious cycle. my doctor cant control the flare ups of my uveitis because highering the dose of pretforte only makes the pressure in my eye increase, the highest it has been is 47. this has gone on for over 17 months, with my school and social life suffering because no doctor can locate the cause of my uveitis. it is only now that my doctor has said enough is enough looking at how often I have had to come and how many eye drops I have had to use every single day realising that this cannot just be idiopathic and from nothing but that something must be causing this relentless condition and that it needs to be looked at more thoroughly so she is bringing it up at a consultants meeting asap. the symptoms I have had since diagnosis are, extreme tiredness (sleeping for at least 12 hours every single night and if not feel exhausted), muscle weakness in legs and arms, sore joints in arms legs and sore back, sore scalp, blocked ears (no one sees any signs of ear problems), random swollen glands, no energy, lack of concentration, repeated cold sores, headaches.

Some people find the idiopathic diagnosis hard to accept and one of my uveitis friends had her consultant chasing cause for over ten years. Her consultant is one active in uveitis research and I think it was one of the happiest of her uveitis days when he told her she had a recently discovered, very rare auto immune disease. By that time, he had her on a drug that controlled her uveitis and was also effective at controlling her underlying disease.","I hope you get some answers soon and with them, a clear direction about the way forward for you.",Maxine,,"My story is that since the age of 10 I have experienced the chronic fatigue (“oh she’s always tired""), the pain in my sacrolitic joints, lower back (“oh it’ll be growing pains” or “sitting awkwardly” “period pains” etc), the sore scalp (“oh get dandruff shampoo”).  At 35 I was in so much pain I was referred for an x-ray (at a geriatric hosp!!!) and misdiagnosed with an illness “that’ll burn  itself out”.   It didn't.",Fast forward to age 52 when I ended up at Moorfields with a really bad uveitis attack (misdiagnosed by my GP as conjunctivitis – during the 2 weeks I was in absolute agony).  Moorfields saved my sight just in time with an injection into my eye. The condition is now chronic in both eyes and I have to stay on the steroid drops for life now.,"I'm so sorry you've had to go through this, especially at such a young age. I've had very similar symptoms and I hope my experience will help you.","You do ask what caused this - Infections or vaccines seem to very good triggers for autoimmune disease, including uveitis. You do mention you've had repeated tonsillitis, for me it was a flu vaccine.","Regardless of the initial trigger, perhaps surprisingly, food intolerances are strongly linked with autoimmune disease. Here is a publication from 1963 linking uveitis and food intolerance. Most people don't realise they have food intolerance so I'd strongly advise you look into this even if you don't identify as having food intolerance/ allergy. It's definitely worth trying to cut out gluten and dairy from your diet in the first instance as there is a good chance this will help get the inflammation under control. There is an amazing allergy clinic who can test and also treat/ cure intolerance/ allergy","Sorry you've had such a rough time - I'm glad this is now being discussed with a consultant and hope that brings new treatment plans and hope, there are other options other than oral steroid. Have you discussed your other symptoms with your GP - perhaps they could also refer you to a rheumatologist to see if that avenue brings any clarity?","The reason it has crossed my mind to check back is because after all of this time, I have been to a chest specialist for the heart palpitations I was suffering as I told my doctor my dad suffers with asthma this is where I was sent. From there they found nothing, only that my breathing was slightly below average and have given me a peak flow measure for four weeks to see if any changes in environment effect my breathing. The doctor also referred me to the right place once this was cleared up, cardiology where I will be getting a 48 hour heart monitor fitted to check my heart. I believe this has only come about as a side effect of one of the drugs I have been on and am not too worried about it. The doctor here was also concerned that I had never had a blood test to check my thyroid so sent me to get this done and I am awaiting results.",,,,,,,,,,,http://allergymedicaluk.com/,". I hope it encourages you to know that I've used this approach to completely get my uveitis under control - no symptoms, no drugs :-). 
 Your other symptoms ( joint and back pain) do point towards you have Ankylosing Spondylitis. Your Doctor should test to see if you have the HLAB27 gene which is strongly linked to Ankylosing Spondylitis. The good news is that you should be able to control your joint and back pain by eliminating starch from your diet. The reason for this is your immune system is attacking klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria. If you have HLAB27 gene your joints and back resemble klebsiella pneumoniae and are basically victims of friendly fire from your immune system. By cutting out starch you starve this bacteria of their food source so there are less enemies for your immune system to attack and your joints and back get a break.
 Please do try this and hang in there. Using this approach I live medication and symptom free. After 5 years I have 20/20 vision. I have shared my experience with my optometrist who passed it on to fellow uveitis patients who are also getting similar benefit. I sincerely hope you will too and  this allows you to get on with the rest of your young life. ",,"@Wendy - I also wanted to respond to your comment about needing steroid drops now for life - please explore other treatment options to break the cycle, anti TNF can be very effective. I too have AS, which presented first with uveitis and similarly became chronic. We tried various immunosuppressants over the years but humira has been my absolute miracle drug - both for the eyes and joints. If you are HLA B27 +ve, then please taper steroids VERY slowly - this was one thing I learnt over 10 years of flares. Where previously I'd flare within about 2 weeks of stopping steroids the ""usual"" way (ie. dropping a drop a time, over a number of days - finally going from 1 drop to none) - slowing that down even more helped break the chronic cycle completely for me. So 1 drop/day, normally for a week, then 1 drop every other day for a week, etc... It's almost 2 years now since I last used steroid drops, so the Humira really has helped to bring this under control too. Please explore options with your consultants to break the steroid drop cycle rather than staying on them indeterminately.","Wishing all of you all the best,",,"In terms of Rheumatology, my eye doctor sent me here once I told her about the soreness and stiffness and I don't know if it is the same for anyone else but I only feel like this during flare ups, which seem to correspond with flare ups in my eye which at the moment is all quiet. this makes the whole process very frustrating because now that I have been there ive felt fine during this period and the first time I went I was discharged even though I tested positive for blood test ANA. My eye doctor pulled this up and referred me back again, this appointment was only yesterday and once again the doctor says he is looking for swelling or inflammation of tissue in my joints and cant find any, he said many people test positive for ANA and are diagnosed with nothing. the doctor didn't ask me any questions regarding my general well being or what symptoms I have so I didn't want to push as I don't want to seem like I'm looking for something which may not even be there. When I did mention to him that it was my immune system which seems to be the problem with me he said yes a lot of people suffer with tonsillitis and sore ears at your age, because your white blood cell count is normal I am not concerned with this. Does anyone have any information on this?",I recently spoke with someone who has been diagnosed with graves and also one of my aunties who I went to visit in Australia who's baby daughter has a food intolerance and they have both done a lot of research into things themselves and have both suggested to me just by looking at me and seeing my behaviours that it seems to them like lupus. if anyone has any information on this could you please let me know too? Any good doctors or specialists who can look into things like this? one of the ladies suggested an endocrinologist?,"In regards to my eye, I am now taking alphagan, yellox and azopt morning and night, lotemax four times daily, pred forte once and lumigan once. the doctors main focus recently was on lowering my pressure because it had been dangerously high in the top 30's for a couple of months so she reduced pred forte right down and introduce lotemax as the substitute. this has definitely brought the pressure down which is now back at 16, and she says my eye is looking clear but I don't know if this is just me but my eye seems to feel more heavy and is much more blurry when she says it is at a good point rather than when it is bad? the lid is very heavy and looks swollen and my vision isn't great.",If anybody has any information I would really appreciate it.

It was the amazing consultant at Moorfields who asked if I suffered from back ache  (tick), if I had flaky sore skin (tick), if I had fatigue (tick).    As I answered a big YES to all of those questions she referred me to a rheumatologist at St Thomas’ Hospital who booked me in for an MRI scan - and there it was after putting up with fatigue, painful flare ups of bones, horrid bouts of psoriasis – my diagnosis of AS may as well have been written in large capital letters on my forehead.    I can’t say I was thrilled – actually I was and still am very scared – but at least I now have a name and a reason for what I am suffering.  I now have regular checks at both hospitals, attend physio and hydro and I have been recommended to have Anti-TNF medication - which will slow down the AS and calm down my eyes.   I’m now 55 so it has been a long journey of discovery for me (though I have to say I never used to visit a GP until absolutely unbearable).   Its since been said that I have had uveitis flare ups before but was just lucky that they eased off without medication or ill effect (must have been the many bouts  of “conjunctivitis” I had in my youth.  Also, AS hides itself very well until quite advanced so x-ray’s  aren’t much good for finding it.   I also had a blood test to see if I had a particular gene – which I did.","Of course the above may be totally irrelevant to you and the reason for your uveitis may be quite different but I just thought the similarities were too, well, similar and it might be worth you asking your GP to refer you to a rheumy.",http://draxe.com/4-steps-to-heal-leaky-gut-and-autoimmune-disease/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a lot to deal with on your own.

Ophths used to treating uveitis will start the drop treatment at that point if the patient has had previous bouts of inflammation and knows another attack is about to begin.",I hope your inflammation resolves easily and quickly.,In answer to your question it looks like it was the front of my eye which was affected this time but not sure about last. To add problems I also have blood vessels in both eyes which have caused bleeding  and made small black spots in my vision.,I don't have a follow up appointment but assume I should have one after finishing the medication?

A rare disease is defined by the European Union as one that affects less than 5 in 10,000 of the general population. Research shows  one in 17 people, or 7% of the population, will be affected by a rare disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"From 22 February on  our Twitter and  Facebook channels we will highlight diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, birdshot uveitis, achromatopsia and Stargardt disease which affect some of our patients.","On 29 February between 12.30-1.30pm our web chat will give a chance for staff, patients and the general public to ask Professor Michaelides, consultant ophthalmologist, about rare eye conditions through this link  http:​//www.​moorfields.​nhs.​uk/event/rare-disease-day-web-​chat.","Rare Disease Day has also attracted the support of the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, who are calling for patients’ voices to be heard. Patients and the general public can leave messages of support for people with rare diseases via ballot boxes in Moorfields’ clinics or online here http:​//www.​brcophthalmology.​org/rare-disease-day-2016​.",Retinal disorders overtook diabetes as the third leading cause of severe sight impairment in England and Wales in 2013.

Currently there is no cure. Joshua said: “The form of RP that I have results in a very limited peripheral field and reduced night vision. I really struggle to see in low light, that includes a dimly lit room, at dusk and dawn and when the sun is beginning to set. I have my central vision but I have no outer vision.”","Now 26, Joshua continues to be seen at Moorfields: “It’s incredibly bittersweet whilst I’m here because it forces me to think about my RP and it’s not the most pleasant thing to think about. It also fills me with so much gratitude because I’m still able to live a relatively normal life.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herpes is a virus and remains in the system for life or until someone finds a cure. It will flare dependent on the immune state.,Acyclovir helps slow the rate of reproduction of the virus during these flares. For Acyclovir to work optimally therapy needs to be initiated within 48 hours of the start of the flare. Once the flare has established itself its affect is pretty minimal. You need to have a course of acyclovir on hand so that when a flare starts you can start it immediately.,As others have said herpes is very contagious. On the positive side this may be the key cause in Owens case and Acyclovir used correctly certainly can help control the situation.,Unfortunately as with many uveitis cases it's become curiouser and curiouser!  If it makes you feel any better we still haven't got to the bottom of Olivia's rashes and blisters nearly 2 years later and Rheumy has suggested a biopsy.  Can't say it's in my top 10 events to do this summer!,,,,,,,,"On monday morning before the pain went i phoned gp's couldnt get appoinment til today, so we went explained how strange it sounds about the leg pain, then it suddenly stopping then the eczema coming.  It turns out owen has herpes simplex, he said like shingles, which keeps coming back every few weeks.  He is going to call the rheumy and eye doc to tell them, and said there isnt anything he can do.  He said the pain in his legs are nerve pains, going down his nerves in his legs, then it stops and the rash comes likes blisters.",I feel so terrible just thinking it was eczema and just ignoring the pain as the rheumy said prob just growing pains.,Is it possible this has caused uveitis.,How will have got it,Regards,Rob,,"Read up on every document you can find to do with his symptoms, it might be a wild goose chase but you never know you might discover something pertinent.",Take care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I dont have cold sores or sti's like that, has it come from me",I feel so bad at the moment and struggling to understand how my son may have this  :(((((,,,,,,Nicki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I love any comments of my story to give me confidence that I am getting the right treatment as I am becoming a little disheartened lately whilst trying to stay positive.  Here goes...I initially started with a sore right eye which after 2 days became much worse, I attend my local opticians suspecting I may have a ulcer due to my contact lenses. I was told she couldn't see an ulcer or anything but would get one her colleagues to do a 2nd check. The colleague immediately sent me to the emergency eye hospital closeby telling me I had a sever case of uveitis.  That night I had a dexamethasone  injection into the eye and was given eye drops and given an appointment for outpatients the next week.  I was back in the emergency clinic 2 days later as it had become much worse, unbearable. More injections, scans- was told they couldn't see into my eye as it was so severe- very 'soupy', started oral steroids 60mg, several eye drops and commenced toxoplasmosis treatment, had syphilis tests, lfts, fbc, chest X-ray- all clear.  I lost most vision in the eye for several weeks and over the course of the next few months it did improve.  Now 7 months later it's still ongoing, they tried twice to reduce my oral steroids and each time it come back with a vengeance so now I am back upto 20mg prednisolone and was told they may consider a vitrectomy or immunosuppressants if I have another relapse.  I forget which type I have been told it is either intermediate or panuveitis , I can't remember.","Does this sound like typical uveitis ?

Uveitis is a complete nightmare, it can very persistent and soul destroying but there are people in the UK, with chronic uveitis, who have found the right doctors and after a struggle have managed to get their uveitis in remission. My family are still trying..... Keep thinking we are moving forward and then something whether it be a dodgy blood test result or more cells crops up. Contact OV directly, Maxine might be able to recommend a uveitis specialist centre that is near to you, so you can start the referral process. Best to go to your GP with a name and centre in mind.

I've yet to find a doc that is fully interested in me getting better treatment. I Constantly have a flare up and that's not a lie. The longest I've gone in the last 5 years without steroids is 4 months!!! Anyone else have the same problems?? I'm hla b27 and told to get on with it surely not....",,,,,,"there is a list of them. The fact that you are still using steroid after 5 years worries me a bit as the side effect may kick in soon. In my case I got cataract and steroid was possibly partly attributed to my high IOP as well, both of which were more severe than the inflammation.","However please don't be too disheartened. The fact that I have been with this for so many years and still manage to keep my eyes intact without surgeries means you may be the same. I also got quite bad doctors to begin with, and only found a decent one since last year. But I always regret not finding a specialist earlier and stop steroid before all the side effects.","B27 associated uveitis can respond to treatment slightly differently, so it is useful to know that. I would also strongly encourage you to seek a specialist referral - it's time to break that cycle! I started with 3 separate flares in one eye, a year off (yay!) and then the other eye became chronically inflamed - I think I could only have about 2 weeks off steroid at the time before it would kick off again.","I found my specialist, we started immunosuppression and importantly he had me slow down the final taper completely - so rather than one drop a day for a week then stop, it became one drop/day, then one drop every other day, and then only stop. I've since learnt this is a B27 thing - we often know when we're flaring very early, and can therefore do a short sharp burst of steroid to stop it in it's tracks - then weaning off very slowly. The overall steroid load was smaller for me this way, which is definitely a good thing.","In time, we broke that horrid chronic cycle with immunosuppression - my steroid induced cataract hasn't changed, so that's good.

I started on treatment of steroid tablets, I reacted very badly to these and had to be taken off them. When first diagnosed I felt helpless as no one understood how it felt to have this condition as there is so little information and awareness out there about it and every symptom I felt I tended to try and ignore for fear of looking for an underlying cause which wasn't there. Five years later, my body is still not the same, I have gone from 6 different eyedrops daily down to 3 different drops - Azopt twice daily, Pred forte twice daily, Nevenac four times daily. Once my doctor discovered Nevenac after asking a specialised doctor in a conference one day as she was so frustrated with my fluctuating eye pressure and unstable condition my treatment has completely changed. I have gone from visiting the hospital every two weeks to visiting every three months which has taken the burden off my life a lot, my condition is now stable it has not gone away it is just at a level that she is happy that it is not causing catastrophic damage. I have also since then developed a cataract in my left eye as a result of constant use of steroids and high pressure.",I am still convinced even though my doctor has given up hope that I have something underlying within my body that is causing this problem as I have recently started being treated for psoriasis in my scalp which is very painful and is not very reactive to treatment. I have also started to develop problems with my bowels that I have never had before and I constantly feel sick whenever I eat. I was wondering if anyone has had these problems and found an underlying cause for their uveitis?,Not sure what type of uveitis you have. Uveitis does not always have an underlying condition. There will always be charlatans out there to tell u what u want to hear. What is your cell count?,,,,"Since your uveitis is chronic and requires daily treatment, I would be inclined to ask for referral to a uveitis specialist who sees chronic cases all the time and will be able to give answers to your questions about possible cause.  There are excellent specialists in Manchester. Your GP or eye doctor could make this referral for you. It's probably better to wait until you have answers to autoimmune issues before consulting a nutritionist and if one is needed, I would ask your GP to recommend one so you avoid Ghost's charlatans.","Don't be embarrassed about seeking a consultation with a uveitis specialist. You've had uveitis for five years now, you have pressure problems and a developing cataract alongside psoriasis which isn't responding well to treatment and bowel issues.

2014-10-13 14:09:48,"Hello, this is my first post on here and I have found reading the threads on this forum very helpful.  I hope someone can help me.  Went to Moorfields, City three weeks yesterday because of  having more floaters and shadows in one eye.  (I already suffer from floaters and dry eyes).  We, my huband and I, thought the Dr told me that I would have a Uvi Test – neither of us understood that he said I had Uveitis, as I had never heard of it before.  When I told the Dr. that I was using eye drops (for dry eyes) about 12x times a day but they weren’tgiving me any relief he prescribed, steroid eyedrops, Maxidex for one month.  He said that he would write to Moorfields, Tooting to make an appointment for me.  If my symptoms cleared up before my appointment then I should cancel it,  as the tests done at the hospital would not show what the problem was if the condition had cleared up.  The condition hasn’t really cleared up as my eye is very dry, my vision is abit blurred, more floaters and feels very sore.  I have not received a hospital appointment.  I don’t know what I should do now, should I go back to Moorfields in the City again?, if it hasn’t cleared up completely after one month.  After reading different threads on the forum I understand that the tests for Uveitis include a Chest x-ray regardless of whether you are having a Uveitis flare-up.  Also you can just go to the Uveitis Clinic held on a Thursday at Moorfields, Tooting.  I already am an out-patient at Moorfields Tooting, for another eye condition, and understood that you could not go there unless you had an appointment.

I have IBS and after seeing two gastroenterologists I was referred to a dietician and put on the Low-Fodmap diet which is a diet that eliminates different food stuffs as IBS sufferers cannot tolerate certain food sources.  That has restricted what I can eat and then a few months ago after having a blood test I was told I had high cholesterol (my mother had a stroke so it is generic) and I now have to follow two very restrictive diets.  This has caused me so much stress that I am sure that my gut problems and me having Ehlers- Danlos Syndrome is having a direct impact on my overall health particularly my eyes.,,,,,,,,I'm sorry it was too much trouble for your GP to actually help you with the promised appointment. Unfortunately many do not know much about uveitis. You have done the right things - waited for an appointment letter and then sought the assistance of your GP.,"Like you, I have no idea whether continuing with Maxidex is the right thing to do. However, I know it would be the right thing to do if a doctor had examined your eyes and said, 'Continue with the drops!'","I would ring eye emergency at Tooting or St George's and say you have been on Maxidex for a month following a diagnosis of uveitis and have received no follow up appointment to check your inflammation and the impact of steroid drops on your eye pressure although an appointment in a (uveitis clinic ?) was promised four weeks after diagnosis. Mention that you are a first time user (?)of Maxidex, state that your symptoms have not improved and your eye hurts. If you don't get invited to attend the clinic you ring, perhaps just turn up at the other one?","I shouldn't be cynical (because the NHS is fantastic when it works) but the whole process of getting and receiving appointments is a nightmare. My heart sinks if a doctor says they write a letter because you know it will take two weeks for the letter to be typed up. Another week for it to arrive. Another two weeks for the letter to get to the right department etc, etc. I don't know what is wrong with email! Then you have to wait for available space.","When I went to A&E the Dr told me that he would make an appointment for me to have tests after I had completed the course of eye-drops.  I just understood that the tests weren't done in A&E  I tapered the Maxidex drops down from 4 drops in the first week to 1 drop in the fourth week. The letter sent to my gp from A&E stipulated,treatment: Uveitis review in 4-6/52, which I received after I started my first post.  Perhaps if I had known at the onset that the review would have been in 4/6 weeks and not 4 weeks, I might not have started getting so worried.   Because I have had a vitreous detachment in the eye that now has Uveitis I am, I think, understandably over-anxious.","I just want to say how much comfort your posts have given me.  I think, for those who have just been diagnosed with Uveitis, that there should be some readily available material and written in layman's terms. From what I understood from reading about uveitis was,that if uveitis was not treated early it could lead to loss of vision; Cataracts from using steriods and Glaucoma developed from uveitis.  I did not understand that if the uveitis had cleared up, with steriods how nothing would show up when you had tests done, blood tests, and either\both a chest or back x-ray.",,,,,,,,,,Wish I could be more helpful.,Maxine,,"Also, I would still consider going back to eye casulty if you can face it. I think you have reason enough. A couple of weeks on Maxidex aught to yield some improvement and if you are worried and in pain go back to eye casulty. If nothing else you could ask for your eye pressure to be checked and this time you can armed with questions.",All the best,,"Thanks Maxine for outlining the condition and procedure so clearly, I appreciate that A&E  doctors just do not always have the time to explain the condition.",,,,,,,That sounds very promising that your Birmingham patient group has been consulted about the issue of Uveitis.  It is a step in the right direction as people being diagnosed with this disease do need to know about this condition. My gp wasn't able to give me any help at all.

A couple of weeks ago we went for a check up and found out the vision in his right eye had all but gone due to a cataract.

It must of been a horrible few weeks, a huge shook then surgery.","I always have HUGE trouble with this. I also have trouble with consultant letters that come through the door! They always cause me a lot of grief! There are two types of flare, there is the one that counts the cells and there is another type of flare which grades the amount of 'liquid released by the cells'. Now that really is how I understand it and I would quite happily hold my hand up and say that I am happy if somebody corrects me. So I guess the flare graded one in both eyes relates to the amount of haze 'I.e liquid left by the cells' and the grading for the cells (e.g 0.5 and 1) relates to the actual number of cells in your son's eyes. So that would be a 1 + flare and trace flare in the other according to the grading system the hospital uses.","However, it does confuse me also because I would read it as just 1 cell in one eye but you can't have half a cell (0.5) in the other. So I think I would ring the consultant's secretary and ask if the consultant could clarify his comments.","To be honest,  now when we are told my son has a such, a such flare. I have to ask - How may cells is that?  We have had incidences when my husband has taken him to an appointment and said he has one cell, which is actually not the case.

As for the injection, the procedure was fine, they make a big deal about it though. You properly get admitted then discharged and i had to get changed into gowns. I wasnt even allowed to walk back from theatre. It was painless and quick though. The worst part of the procedure was the clip they put on to keep eyelids open but it doesnt hurt, just an odd feeling. The afternoon afterwards was horrible though.

I have been lucky so far and have had minimal side effects from the medications, nothing as yet unmanageable - irritating but not what it could have been - (the worst one is the weekly Alendronic Acid!!)",,,,,"Fingers crossed the injection went well, hope it wasn't too uncomfortable - and it gets better soon.",Donna :-),"Donna, I think I was very lucky I had intermediate and anterior in my left eye, but it cleared up within 2 months and I'm all drop free now :) I only had 3 appointments and that included my final checkup so I guess I had a mild attack.","I do have a question. I'm guessing it was the anterior that made me go to the Dr's as the eye went red, painful and my pupil stuck in an odd way which was when I noticed the eye sight change too. If you get intermediate uveitis only is it just a change in the vision that you get or did you also had the red eye/ pain too?","I can't rely on the pupil thing as my left eye's pupil seems to be a bit lazy now and it dilates slower and not as quite much as the right one, strangely it is more marked in the mornings and more normal midday.",Are you all done with appointments now or do you have to go back less frequently just to monitor?,,"Hi Eve, I had my consultant appointment yesterday - he said there is a 95% improvement - I did say I was slightly concerned that I felt a slight deteroration over the last few days, he said he could see that when he looked at the back of my eyes - so continuing with the steroid reduction but at a slower rate and back again at the end of August. Fingers crossed it continues.","BW to you both, Donna :-)",,,,,"I was just wondering if there are any specific questions I should be asking, or anything I should or shouldn't be doing, or symptoms I need to look out for?","Thanks so much in advance, this really is my first port of call for information.",Donna,,I am just aware that I want to keep a look out as I don't want to leave it as long as I did last time.

We too were told that he has conjunctivitis and for 12 days was on cream that was obviously doing him no good.  A more on the ball GP referred us to Moorfields where he was diagnised with uveitis and they think he probably had it for a long long time.  I really sympathise with you as they can give no answer as to why Harrison has it and although in one respect I am so grateful he does not have any other underlying condition as so many children with this condition do, I am still yearning to find out why.","I am not going to try and give you good medical advice as I am only learning about the condition myself and there are others on this site who are much more well informed than me, but I am learning and I bet you are too!! Harrison too has tested negative on all the bloods but he is now being referred to an immunologist as he has no anti bodies to chickenpox even though he has had it.  His tonsils are always enlarged and if I took him to a GP today they would prescribe antibiotics even though he is fine as they would automatically think he has tonsilitis.  However, we do know his immune system is hyperactive and so an immunologist is the next step.  Please let me know how you get on.  Harrison is down to one Maxidex drop per day and this is the best its been since January when he was diagnosed too. I have to say that you son must be ever so brave with the injections as we have luckily not had to do this with Harrison.

Good luck too with the steroid side effects.,"Take care,",Maxine.,,"Going to appointments demented with worry and side effects, I used to take a list of questions. It made things simpler. If you read this in time, I'd ask what has happened to your pupil. Is there more adhesion or less? Does it look stranger because atropine has magnified the effect of the adhesion? I'd also ask what effect the steroid is having on the inflammation - ask for the cell count and the flare and what these figures were for the appointment when oral steroid was prescribed. If they haven't reduced, ask for an explanation and a plan of what will be done next.","Getting to a rheumatologist is a must, so I really hope you see the same doc you saw last time. If she's in clinic, ask to see her and say you don't mind waiting to do so.","considering you're on high dose steroid I thought you were incredibly coherent!  Uveitis knocks you off your feet at the best of times but throw in steroids, sight loss, joint pain and worry and it's a recipe to make the most stable person into a nervous wreck.","I'm delighted you have a supportive GP, this will make all the difference.  As Maxine said ask if there's been any improvement concerning the level of flare and active cells.  Both are measured on a scale of 0 - 4+","Best of luck for todays appointment, let us know how you get on.","So pleased to hear that there has been improvement in the inflammation and that it sounds like you're now getting thorough care! I find that my visual acuity is impacted quite quickly by any drops - either dilating or steroid - but with patience it has generally returned to as good as before - one ""advantage"" (?!) of HLA-B27 uveitis is that I can now tell when I'm flaring so tend to catch it very early.","My Prof's office is also used for a paediatric clinic. There was once a teddy bear sitting on a shelf amongst the books. It shouted, 'Hug me,' when held. Have occasionally thought we adults could do with that bear as much as the kids!",Good news that the inflammation is being brought under control. At least you know there is benefit from the high dose steroid.,"I wish the rheumatologist appointment were sooner than October, so that you could be started on something else, if needed, while the steroid is being reduced.","It is normal to feel down when high dose steroid is being reduced and also to feel physically uncomfortable. I remember using over the counter nsaids for the stomach discomfort and also took probiotics. Whether it was time or probiotics, the discomfort passed in a couple of weeks. The low mood persisted for ages and after the intense weepy stage, I just tried to avoid situations where I knew I'd be rapidly provoked into snapping. Most people find tapering off steroid very difficult - you're not the exception with that one!",,,,,,,,Take care,Nicki,,Best of luck with the oral steroid taper - hope you get more sleep very soon - and thank you for sharing the lovely family pic with us!,"Take care,","Thank you to everyone who has supported me and good luck to the lady with blurry vision  and bilateral uveitis who mentioned me in her post, so sorry I can't remember your name.",Hope the next reduction in Pred goes OK and seeing a little better continues.,"Take care,",Maxine,,"I sometimes wonder how many people with uveitis actually escape getting a cataract eventually. From the docs' point of view, it's far better to save sight and cause a cataract in the process, than to let sight slip away. However, when it's your eye, you want your sight preserved without developing a cataract! The short sighted do get a bit of a bonus though - a lens implanted that gives good distance vision.","Without steroid messing up emotion, I suspect relief would be the dominant one right now. The inflammation is being brought under control and that's the most important thing.",Good luck with the taper and hope the cells continue to be snuffed out.,"Thanks for your response. Like I said, I'm totally fed up now. It seems to be one thing after another and I've reached the end of my tether. My life for almost 2 months has revolved around predforte (mostly hourly, but less on occasion!),oral prednisolone, mydrilate/atropine and trips to the local hospital and my gp. I have followed the treatment regime to the letter and still there are problems!","As for the ulcerative keratitis - I don't think Mr Redmill knows why I've got ulcer/s on my cornea! I did tell him I was on antibiotics for a bacterial infection in my foot and a chest infection, plus I'd had a tablet for a fungal infection/ulcers in my mouth and Daktarin gel as well. As I said, he did ask me whether I'd ever had a cold sore - the answer is no! My ex-husband suffered with them and kissing was out of bounds if he had an active sore!  I think Mr Redmill is just treating the ulcer/s with aciclovir as a 'let's see if it's that' treatment! So, I'm doing as I'm told but all the time I'm getting more anxious because I've subsequently read that corneal ulcers can cause scarring which affects your vision and if not treated properly can cause blindness!","I may ask for an appointment to see my gp tomorrow - if I'm up to it! The Rheumatologist appointment is 3 October which isn't so far away now.  As for the referral to see Prof Rennie in sheffield, been told it could be months and I have no idea how I can track progress, if any, in that department.",I'm back at the hospital at 9am on Friday - if you have any questions you think i should ask please let me know as I'm completely lost now :(,Fiona,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Really hope there are signs of the inflammation reducing this afternoon.

Then 3 days before Christmas Owen complained if not being able to see much, it was so much more than that, he couldn't even see my nose eyes or mouth, just a blurry outline of my face.  Rather than do our usual mad rush and trek to Alderhey children's hospital our local optician agreed to take a look immediately, after some photos which they couldn't do because he couldn't see and the slit lamp we were told to get straight to Alderhey as it was very serious.

Consultants charge different fees - think of £120 - 200 for a consultation. Should you need tests, for example, OCT and field of vision, in the private sector costs vary according to where the scans are done - a private hospital might charge £400 plus for an OCT and field of vision, whereas an NHS centre may charge a private patient approx. £250 for the same tests. On top of this, you have the cost of drugs. Eye drops, steroid and glaucoma, vary from a few pounds to £25 plus. A local pharmacist would give you the exact costs for the ones you currently use. Small independent pharmacies will sometimes charge less than the large chains.",If your uveitis requires you to move along from steroid onto immunosuppressants or anti virals (Herpes) again the cost of drugs varies from the relatively cheap methotrexate (pounds) to the very expensive anti tnfs (thousands per year). There are also the associated costs of regular blood tests. It's impossible to give you figures to plan a budget for private care - too many variables!,"Quite a few people combine NHS with private care seeing a uveitis consultant on a private basis as need arises for a second or expert opinion on a way forward. Private care is manageable when the uveitis is straightforward to treat, but horribly expensive if it's more complex and requires surgical treatment as well as the medical.","Perhaps you are best off booking an initial private consultation to discuss your symptoms and whether you are best off having NHS or private care? The majority of the uveitis consultants working in the private sector are also NHS consultants. There is a thread below yours (George - Prof A.) which discusses some of the issues and if you are London based, several members are in a position to give you more precise advice about who to see or which NHS uveitis clinic to attend.",topic_3743767,Costs of treatment for uveitis?,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2014-04-04 12:40:59,"Hi Maxine,","Just want to update that I've just met Dr. Ayliffe today.

The bad news is that my uveitis is becoming chronic, but we'll see where it'll go.","The last week was quite horrible for me. Right before the treatment ended eye pressure raised again, so I cut short my vacation and rushed to hospital. I slept a bit on the car and somehow when I got to the hospital the eye pressured went down to normal and the doctor said that everything was fine.

In view of the relapse and panic stricken, I was at the point of considering systemic treatment.

Having Crohns as well as uveitis suggests both conditions could possibly be treated together and being seen in a uveitis clinic helps this to happen if it's appropriate. If after asking for referral, you still have to use A&E because you can't get into a uveitis clinic, someone years ago got round the problem of a lengthy wait by arriving at the emergency eye clinic before it opened. Another thing you could do if you recognise when an attack is beginning, is ask if you could be prescribed a spare bottle of drops so you can self treat before being seen and thus avoid the wait in blinding pain. Of course this does not mean it's okay to self treat and avoid the eye clinic altogether!! You should still go in within 24 hours to make sure what's happening in your eyes and have pressures checked!",So sorry that you have uveitis as well as these other debilitating conditions.

It's good to hear that the clinic is doing blood tests already at this stage - what they will most likely be looking for is various markers indicating possible autoimmune causes (such as those related to rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis) It is possible that they may not find anything, this is then known as idiopathic uveitis - either way it's good that they are doing these investigations as it can influence the treatment choice if necessary. I know it's easier said than done, but try not to worry about it for now - it's good that they're doing the investigation, but the most important thing right now is to get your eyes quiet again which is what the Maxidex is for.","I find my vision blurs even just on Maxidex - after one of my early uveitis episodes I questioned the blurriness with one of the doctors who said it should all be fine again (I'm short sighted anyway...) - so I went and had another prescription done for glasses. I ended up waiting to order them due to the cost of the lenses and found a few weeks later that my vision had returned to ""normal"" (or at least normal for me... my previous prescription was fine!)

Experimental and clinical studies showed that TNF alpha plays a significant role in the process of intraocular inflammation, so it was a logical step to use TNF blocking agents in uveitis therapy. Randomized controlled studies are rare, but pooled data (as presented here) of case series published show good evidence for the efficacy especially of infliximab and adalimumab. It is to be hoped that blindness and severe sight disabilities can be further reduced by this treatment in the future. From pediatric rheumatology we have learned about even newer biologics.

A uveitis specialist will know best whether it's worthwhile doing the tests they usually do when both eyes are affected or the uveitis is chronic. Referrals to a uveitis specialist are made by the eye clinic or by your GP. Your GP can also order the blood tests and x-rays for underlying disease causing uveitis. About half of us turn out to be idiopathic - no cause identified.","I would push for referral because you no longer have simple anterior uveitis, yours has become complicated. The main specialist centres are in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle. There are specialists working in other clinics and if you go to the websites of hospitals near you, the information about their eye clinics will show whether they have a uveitis clinic.","My own experience with uveitis was similar to yours to begin with. I didn't cope at all - do any of us with the type of uveitis that doesn't clear off with a course of drops cope? Getting to a specialist and a rheumatologist made things easier. I also learned as time went on that I'd be in pieces for a day or two when something new (read bad!) happened, but that a couple of days later, while I'd still be unhappy about it, I'd be back to functioning normally again. Recognising that pattern helped.","With work, educating the human resources people about the disease may help.

The episode from start to being discharged from the clinic was approximately 4 months. I was told there maybe a possibility I may have another flare up or I may be lucky and wouldn’t have another one. So December 2017 two weeks before Christmas and I was getting ready to go to a Christmas party and I noticed my eye was very red again and by the Monday morning I was in pain and light sensitive. I called the eye care centre and they managed to get me in that afternoon where it was confirmed that I had another flare up. I was prescribed Pred Forte every hour until review 7 days later, cyclopentolate twice a day and also Azarga twice a day.At my next appointment I was told to reduce the steroid to every two hours for 5 days and then go to 4 times a day, in the meantime at the next appointment the nurse practitioner that I saw decided to stop the steroid completely and within two days the flare up had started again and that is pretty much what has been happening for the last 6 months, I have only had one appointment where I only had a couple of inflammatory cells present and the decision was made to put me on acular a non steroid drop, I managed about 2 weeks before it flared again and ended up back at the hospital the night before I was going on holiday, I was told to increase the acular to 6 times a day and I couldn’t have a steroid as I was flying and there were concerns about the pressure. On my return from my holiday I saw the consultant who decided acular wasn’t working so then tried lotemax which didn’t work either,so back to the hospital again and now I am told I have anterior and intermediate uveitis so currently on Pred forte every 2 hours but going to 4 times a day from tomorrow and dreading it already! I feel like I am going round in circles and at the last visit I was told I have a cataract forming due to the steroids. I have asked for further tests to be done to see if there is a cause or to at least rule that out but the hospital don’t seem to think it’s necessary at this stage. Has anyone else had these difficulties getting further tests done? And if so what did you do? I have previously had an elevated rheumatoid blood result and have seen a rheumatologist but nothing conclusive was found. I am getting frustrated because I have already had a month off work in the last 6 months and up until this uveitis I hadn’t had a day off sick and the possibility of a disciplinary is upsetting and stressful .People look at you and think you look fine when the reality is you are not.

2011-06-21 20:32:28,Hi,topic_668204,Cellcept,,,2011-06-22 00:23:56,"Hi Colin,","So sorry that after a torn retina, you ended up with pan uveitis and choroiditis.",I also have pan uveitis and have experienced the problems you now have.,"The high dose steroid is designed to give you cover from inflammation while the cellcept gets a chance to work. The steroid will also help with the cystoid macular oedema - fluid on the retina causing the distortion in your vision. The idea is that the cellcept, once it has built up and is working, will control the inflammation that causes the cystoid macular oedema. It may take a month or two for this to happen and if it's not having a good enough effect, Moorfields may add another immunosuppressant, often cyclosporine, so that the steroid can be reduced and even eliminated.","There are other ways of getting rid of the cystoid macular oedema, but as the most direct methods involve injections into the eye ( oddly, these hardly hurt!)I don't know if the surgery you had for your retinal tear makes these rather risky. You could ask about having the steroid injected into your eye instead of swallowing the pills and suffering the side effects, or receiving it through an iv infusion (fewer side effects). You could also ask about an injection of lucentis. I'm not sure if this is available for uveitis on the NHS, but if you have private medical insurance, it should be funded. The injections usually resolve the cystoid macular oedema, but they are pointless unless the inflammation is being controlled. If the inflammation isn't controlled, the cystoid macular oedema comes back when the effect of the injections wears off.",topic_668204,Cellcept,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2011-06-22 10:21:17,"Hi Colin,",As if a torn retina wasn't bad enough you now have to go through this.  Do you know what caused the retina to tear in the first place?  How long after the surgery did you develop uveitis?,As Maxine said there's some good info on Cellcept on this website (click,topic_668204,Cellcept,http://www.facebook.com/nicki.davis.1023,Nicki,,"Thanks for the replies. The retinal tear seems to be as a result of my myopia, in particular the oval shape of the eye. Apparently people who are myopic are at much greater risk of retinal tears than those with a normally shaped eye. I had corrective laser surgery for my myopia about 14 years ago and it was a great success, and they say that had nothing to do with the tear developing after all this time. The uveitis developed a couple of weeks after the tear was repaired.",topic_668204,Cellcept,,,2011-06-22 20:46:23,"Hi Colin,",I'm glad to hear that on your present dose you've not suffered any of the common side effects associated with oral steroids.

If you do book a private appointment and find out if anti vegf injection is possible. Ask for Lucentis and get your private medical insurance to pay for it if the consultant tells you it isn't possible on the NHS. Also ask when would be the right time to have it - as soon as possible or wait until the Myfenax is working.,There may be three reasons why a steroid injection isn't being considered.,"You've been on oral steroid for months and it hasn't stopped the inflammation and this latest high dose hasn't had an effect.

It clears the fluid up, often within  two to three hours. The problem is that it doesn't treat the cause of the fliud leaking, the inflammation itself, so when the lucentis wears off about 4 weeks later, you get another bout of cystoid macular oedema. That's why I suggested you should ask if it's better to have it while you're building up the dose of Myfenax, or wait until you know the Myfenax has brought the inflammation under control.",topic_668204,Cellcept,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,2011-08-10 14:26:54,"Hi Colin,",topic_668204,Cellcept,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,,"I had my latest visit to Moorfields yesterday.

To be fair to my consultant I don't think he would be happy with keeping the inflammation down to just a lower level.

Thanks for your's as well. I had no idea that you had lost your sight in one eye as a result of this. It brings it home to me how serious this condition is.,I'm guessing that waiting one week for this injection isn't too long to wait? Especially as my level of inflammation seems to be stable for the moment. I understand that the effects of the injection should be pretty quick.,If it does have a positive effect it would seem that this is just addressing the symptom rather than the cause? Does the injection only address the fluid behind the retina rather than the inflammation? This is confusing me because obviously the oral steroids that I have been on for 6 months now were to address the inflammation weren't they? The injection is just a more targeted version of the steroid isn't it?,"My understanding, and I could be wrong, is that the injection is a way of targeting the inflammation more specifically. And as a result, if it works, it could kick start the effectiveness of the Myfenax in combination with the oral steroids. However, you both seem to be saying that the injection is definitely only temporary and won't address the issue of inflammation in the long term. Is that right?",Many thanks,Colin,,topic_668204,Cellcept,,,2011-09-07 15:41:18,"Hi Colin,",topic_668204,Cellcept,http://www.facebook.com/nicki.davis.1023,Nicki,I'm new to the forum and just wondered if anyone has any experience of being treated with Cellcept?,"I had a torn retina which was treated successfully in November 2010, however I developed pan-uveitis afterwards. I was also diagnosed with choroiditis. I have been on steroids for 6 months now and the plan was for me to finish steroids today. I went for my appointment at Moorfields and they told me the swelling / build up of fluid behind the retina has worsened slightly. Although the cloudiness of my vision has improved a bit the fluid behind the retina is causing distortion of images. I had been on 20mg of prednisolone for the last two weeks but they are now going to increase my dose dramatically again to 60mg for 5 days, 40mg for a week, then 30mg for a week before putting me on Cellcept. The uveitis and choroiditis is only afecting my right eye.","If you go to our treatments section, you will find links to information about cellcept, how to take it and side effects. It's pretty effective at stopping inflammation.","Have Moorfields told you that your uveitis is a consequence of the surgery for your retinal detachment? I only ask because the course of traumatic uveitis might be different to uveitis which is associated with an auto immune condition. In auto immune uveitis, you can expect to take cellcept for at least two years once your eyes are cell free, then the dose is reduced slowly and if you're lucky, your uveitis is in remission, off drugs. In traumatic uveitis, this might be different, so it's probably best to ask Moorfields how long they expect you to be on treatment.",You have our sympathy about the high dose steroid and hopefully you'll see the benefit in your sight to make it worthwhile.,Good luck and please keep us informed of your progress.,here ,"for link). I know a couple of people who've had great success with it, one of whom's been in remission for 8 months now, the other had to take an additional drug which has done the job, but neither of them had traumatic uveitis (one's idiopathic one's autoimmune). My daughter was advised not to go on cellcept because she has a particularly sensitive stomach, but a lot of people seem to suffer from absolutely no nausea at all and tolerate it really well.","They haven't said whether the uveitis is as a consequence of the tear, but my gut feeling is that it is. It was only a small tear and I realise now that I was living with the very mild symptoms of it for a good couple of months before it was significant enough for me to get it checked out. I have also had all the standard blood tests and chest x-rays which all came back negative. They seem pretty sure it is idiopathic uveitis, although they are talking about doing a couple of other tests in three weeks time (although the consultant said he expects those to be negative).","Thanks for the info about alternative methods e.g. injections etc. I'm going to go along with their preferred treatment for now. Funnily enough I haven't really had any adverse side effects from the oral steroids (well none that I know of!), and it has worked wonders for the little bit of psoriasis I suffer from! I will ask them if they think the uveitis is as a result of the tear. Am I right in thinking it could be one of three things:",1. Traumatic uveitis as a result of the tear,As far as I know I haven't had an ANA test. I will ask about it next time.,Yes I do still have cystoid macular oedema. That was one question I did get to ask the consultant and he said that it is linked to the inflammation. His implication was that the inflammation was causing the leaking of fluid behind the retina and into the choroid (not sure if I got that right!).,I think we were posting at the same time!  You can read all about,Lucentis here.,Hope this helps,No ideas at all about tooth sensitivity.,Glad the private appointment was helpful and really pleased your other eye remains unaffected.,"Hope the steroid injection and the full dose Myfenax both start having an effect and the cystoid macular oedema begins to resolve. The steroid injections are effective for many people and depending on the type you were given, their effect can last for several months. While their effect can last longer than an anti vegf injection, they come with more potential side effects such as raised ocular pressure and cataract formation.",Has anyone else been treated with Cellcept? How long was the treatment? Did it work? Any side effects?,Sorry for all the questions but I'm learning more and more about this as I go along!,,,2. Auto immune uveitis,3. Idiopathic uveitis,At least there looks like a possibility of resolving the distorted vision. Until yesterday I though the distortion was as a result of scarring on the retina and therefore wouldn't be reversible. It was only after asking them more questions that I realised that the distortion was caused by fluid behind the retina causing the rippling effect.,Thanks,Colin,"Your eye pressure might be rising as a side effect of the steroid, or they don't want to give you a cataract from the steroid and put that eye through further surgey.","I have an appointment with my GP on Friday to get a referral letter for the private appointment. Are you saying Lucentis is an ""anti vegf injection""? What is that?","Thanks for the info about the rest of it, Myfenax etc., that's made me feel a lot better about it. I'll certainly look forward to having the chance to discuss things in more detail with the consultant.",Regards,Colin,Nicki,,,"I've had injections of it and having gone in not able to read the floor numbers in a lift, I've had driving sight three hours later. It's pretty marvellous stuff.",Just seen Nicki has posted you a link to it while I'm typing!,,,,,"It's quite common to have a second immunosuppressant added, but some people do manage on Myfenax alone - hope you're one of those.","I got my information slightly wrong last time I posted. The steroid injection I had a month ago was injected around the eye and not into the eyeball, but that obviously didn't have the desired effect either.","Rather than put me on Ciclosporin as well at this stage the consultant decided yesterday that I will remain on the same level of medication (15mg of Prednisolone and 2mg of Myfenax per day), and they are going to give me a steroid injection directly into the eyeball next Tuesday. The thinking is that my current level of medication seems to be keeping the inflammation stable, and that the injection might bring it down further so that the medication can at least keep it at a better level or even start to improve it.","First of all, sorry the steroid injection around the eye didn't do the trick and Myfenax, so far, doesn't seem to be fully effective.","Nicki has been forthright in her comments above and having pan uveitis myself, I'm very aware of how sight threatening this type of uveitis is and how insiduously and quickly vision can be lost, if inflammation is not controlled. 'Wait and see' resulted in me not seeing in one eye. Pan uveitis can also be a difficult type of uveitis to treat and it's not uncommon for two types of immunosuppressants to be needed. Even then, a number of us fail those treatments and require biologic therapy. If it helps to know, an American GP who developed uveitis after retinal detachment surgery, did very well on a combination of Cellcept and Cyclosporine. I can ask her to contact you here if you would like.","As I said before, it's often difficult to fully discuss everything at a busy clinic - especially when you are learning more and more about the condition as you go along.","I haven't been on Myfenax for 3 months yet, so I suppose they are hoping that, with the steroid injection, it still might be the drug that works for me. I have seen various reports saying that it takes one month, six weeks, three months etc. I think I should at least give it three months and then I will definitely know if it's working or not!","Your information is invaluable because I didn't even know they have ""levels"" of inflammation, and I will be able to discuss with him in future if his aim is to eradicate the inflammation completely or whether they are happy to keep it at a low level. As I say, I do believe the aim is to eradicate it but at least I have more knowledge now to discuss it with him.",Many thanks,Colin,Maxine.,Take care,"Unfortunately it's like all these drugs, everybody reacts differently and it's not until you take it that you know whether you can tolerate it or if it's going to work.  Methotrexate seems to be the standard initial immunosuppressant prescribed but I can't say my daughter's been exactly great on that either!  Cellcept is great in that if mtx doesn't work, cellcept can be successful and it's in tablet form but you have to take it on an empty stomach 12 hours apart...They all have their pros and cos you just have to try them and see what works for you.","Best of luck, let us know how things go at your next appointment.",Nicki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thanks for updating us and let's hope your next appointment brings some good news about the inflammation and the cystoid macular oedema.,"Take care,",Maxine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Has anyone else got experience of the steroid injection directly into the eye and how successful it has been?,Many thanks,,,Your previous retinal surgery might make an injection too risky.

I was surprised to read that under this circumstance adding cyclosporine did not happen.","It may be that getting the steroid directly into the eye will make a difference, but as Nicki told you, that's likely to be a time limited difference.","Good luck with the injection itself,",Maxine,With your history a steroid injection is unlikely to be the long term answer to your prayers.

I'm careful where I eat and what I choose from menus.","With side effects, you adapt to them over time more often than them subsiding! If they are too bothersome, they'll try a different drug instead. If blood tests show an adverse effect, again a different drug will be used. You'll have regular blood tests to keep a watch on the side effects.","How long you remain on Myfenax is something to ask the consultant. With autoimmune uveitis it is often for two years at least. With your uveitis, if it's traumatic uveitis, it might be different.","The ANA test picks up autoimmunity. I expect it's already been done. Again, ask at the consultation for the results of all your tests and an explanation of what they were for and what the results mean.","From what you've written about the change in treatment, it sounds as though a second opinion, at this point, would not be helpful. Myfenax is effective and another consultant is likely simply to tell you to try it and see if it works.","I hope it does work and you're soon at the stage of inflammation put out, macular oedema gone and life returned to normal, albeit with Myfenax.

2013-02-19 22:53:22,How long can steriod eye drops be used? Before becoming a concern ??,topic_2413424,treatment,http://www.facebook.com/Cobby82,EmmaCobb,2013-02-20 14:15:24,"Hi Emma,",It depends.,"For some patients, using steroid eye drops to control anterior inflammation is the safest treatment, even though eventually they will cause cataracts to develop. These patients typically have no diagnosed systemic autoimmune disease which requires treatment and their flare ups of acute uveitis come with lengthy intervals between them. If steroid drops raise ocular pressure, that can be managed with pressure lowering drops. In these cases, the eventual development of cataract and short lived, manageable pressure problems are considered lesser evils than the potential side effects of immunosuppressant drugs.","When inflammation is chronic, steroid eye drops do become a concern, especially if they affect pressure. In these cases, patients are offered immunosuppressant drugs like methotrexate. Once the immunosuppressant is controlling inflammation, the steroid drops can be tapered and stopped. In an ideal world, the transition between drops and immunosuppressants would occur before cataract development has begun or there are problems with pressure. In the real world, it can be three to six months and sometimes even longer, before a treating doctor has a good idea how the patient's uveitis is likely to pan out and whether or not the patient would benefit from immunosuppression. When immunosuppression treatment is begun, the steroid drops may be needed to put out inflammation while the 'trial and error' of doses and choice of drug takes place.","The situation is further complicated by the treatment preferences of the patients and the treating doctors. Some doctors treat anterior uveitis with drops in the hope that the uveitis will run its course (can take years) and the patient emerge with most sight still intact, albeit with artificial lenses in their eyes and perhaps glaucoma surgery carried out.

2015-09-06 12:50:05,"Hi all, I have posterior uveitis which flares every 2-3 years and the last two episodes have resulted in a significant macula odema. I live in the Portsmouth area and have no faith in my treatment at the eye department there. My last flare up was discovered last December and I was sent home knowing I had significant inflammation and oedema and was given steroid drops to be taken every 2 hours and no follow up offered for SIX weeks! It makes me feel sick to think of all the poor people going home in good faith just going blind as a result. Anyway, having previously been a private and then NHS patient of Prof Ayliffe I made an appointment as soon as I got back from the hospital. I saw him a week later and my inflammation was well controlled but needed to tackle the oedema. (Steroid dropped to 4 times a day and pressure was up so the fact Portsmouth would have left me for 6 weeks means my sight would have been threatened by the treatment and lack of treatment for the oedema)",topic_4951789,"My uveitis journey including NHS/Private mix, cataract surgery and remission",https://plus.google.com/101599902798061649631,stumpyaura,2015-09-07 17:27:35,"Hi Claire,","The helpline is there because we know how terrifying uveitis can be. Glad it helped you. Since uveitis doesn't observe Christmas, neither does the helpline!",So glad you didn't give up and found the strength to fight for better NHS care.,It's a great pity that lack of referral meant you having to self fund your care for a time but there seems little doubt your eye was headed towards loss of vision if you didn't. Reading about your local care is frightening.,Just wish we were all under the care of good specialists from the outset - we'd be spared some of the grief.

Please can I ask do you still see Prof  Ayliffe? Do you need bring your medical record with you? Or will he require it from your consultant in Portsmouth and send back his opinion as well? Besides, how do you convince your gp to help in terms of medicine and test?",Many thanks and really look forward for your advice!,topic_4951789,"My uveitis journey including NHS/Private mix, cataract surgery and remission",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Ayliffe started me on ciclosporin along with various drops and I saw him weekly. He no longer has an NHS clinic but offers a very reasonable rate for self-funders and I truly believes works magic on eyes. I was very desperate around Christmas trying to navigate the mix of private and worrying that it was such a serious condition with serious medication that I felt v vulnerable being out in the wilderness essentially managing my own care. I rang the helpline between Christmas and New Year and spoke to a wonderful lady (thank you whoever you were) who did the right amount of support whilst instilling a sense of fear and urgency that no, I could not stick my head in the sand about this.","I kept my appointment with Portsmouth 3 weeks later just to see what they would say and to take advantage of a free OCT scan and the uveitis 'specialist' there said he wouldn't offer any treatment for my oedema as I am a steroid responder and it would just make my cataract worse and 'everyone I have operated on has had a worse outcome. Eyes filling with fluid, losing sight, massive flares up' imagine how sick and worried and despairing I left that room. So unprofessional I think. He also said as the oedema was so large it may structurally reduce in size but would have damaged my sight anyway as the cells had stretched. I decided there and then never to be at the mercy of that department again and to only use the walk in clinic.","Thanks for posting, Claire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Back to Prof Ayliffe the following week who gave me a steroid injection for the oedema, continued immuno-suppressant meds and various pressure-reducing treatments. It cleared up the oedema within weeks, pressure was managed and all lost vision returned. As predicted it did advance my cataract but it makes sense to me to preserve as much vision as possible and then try and deal with the cataract when appropriate. Otherwise there is 100% possibility of sight loss, first from lack of treatment and eventually from cataract too.","In April Prof Ayliffe felt the time was right for my cataract op as three months inflammation free, still some steroid in my eye to help control post-op inflammation and already on the cocktail of drugs that would be used in complicated cataract surgery (the approach of true uveitis specialists)","My outcome? Successful treatment of inflammation and cataract surgery, vision in my left eye better than it has EVER been, appt last week showed I was inflammation-free and I am gradually tapering my drug levels down.","NHS involvement-in January I made an appointment with my GP and explained the dilemma and asked what they could support me with on the NHS. He agreed to prescribe all the eye drops, do my blood tests for ciclospoirn (as long as the results were faxed to Prof Ayliffe who took responsibility) and agreed to refer me to an out-of-area true specialist. He wrote to Prof Ayliffe for advice on the best person and I was recommended Nigel Hall in Southampton/Winchester and have been so impressed with his approach and openness to my combination of care. He uses immuno-supopresants so I have finally been able to get most of them prescribed via my GP surgery now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private ciclosporin: for several months I funded this myself as the GP was nervous to prescribe until I was within the NHS system again. The best place to get it is from Sainsbury. I rang around a lot of places and they were easily half the price. They prescribed Neoral which when I was taking 150mg twice a day cost about £45 a week. My local one was amazingly flexible and hung on to my private prescription dispensing as and when I needed it to save me the cost of getting it all in one go and as I lived in the hope of getting it on the NHS ASAP.,"In summary you have to become an expert in your own care and patch together the best bits you can find and navigate a way through them all working together. It is SO hard when you are feeling at your lowest and desperate and scared, to motivate yourself, and I just wanted to stick my head in the sand to ignore the fact I had a sight threatening condition which is clearly going to plague me throughout my whole life. If at all possible see Prof Ayliffe, he works miracles and I just do not understand why my local department is not interested in how he achieves it. His cataracts stats are (I hope I have got these right!) 95% improved vision, 3% no change and 2% deterioration. Compare to Portsmouth consultant who told me 100% are worse off. I accept the limitations of a service but I do not accept him not referring me on to another specialist who offers alternative treatment. I would have lost vision in my left eye if I had put my trust in that department.",,,,,,,,,,Obviously it has cost me a lot this year especially with the surgery but I feel that just pushing within the NHS can get you better treatment and each episode that happens I now piece together my care again ready to set it in motion when the next emergency happens.,"I'm really sorry this is so long, I'm not very good at concise. Thank you all who post on here especially those that respond so frequently and give so much support. Thank you to that lady who gave up her time over the Christmas holidays to answer that helpline to me. Good luck to us all in our continued journey with this tricky and awful condition.

She has been on Humira since early December and responded well straight away and has had quiet eyes for the past 3 months! The main problem we had been having recently was with eye pressure which had gone up to 46. So when we went yesterday, for once I didn't even consider the fact that the uveitis would have come back, I was more concerned about the pressure. As it was her pressure was fine but sadly she is having a flare in her right eye, so back to square one today starting back on predforte and cyclopentalate.

Some parents who delay moving on to methotrexate when advised this is the best way forward, later say they wished they had started it sooner as their child deals with inflammation that is chronic, cataracts and in some cases, the problem of raised ocular pressure which becomes difficult to control.","Hearing and reading about the potential side effects of methotrexate is frightening. It helps a bit to keep in mind that methotrexate is used in low doses to treat uveitis and the side effects are therefore considerably less than those experienced by patients on the high doses needed to treat other conditions. With regular blood tests carried out to monitor for side effects, the drug is generally used very safely in uveitis. Should a blood test reveal anything abnormal, the child misses the next weekly dose and does not restart methotrexate until blood results are back to normal. Stopping the drug for a week usually means that the repeat blood test shows things are back to normal. Your daughter will be very well looked after to ensure mtx does her no lasting harm.","The most common side effects experienced by children are feeling tired the next day and nausea. Some children will experience a little thinning of the hair. Some children experience nothing at all. There are ways of dealing with side effects and I imagine you have the number of a specialist nurse who you can ring should anything really worry you. Should a child not be able to tolerate mtx at all, there are other treatments.",topic_5288938,Methotrexate and my three year old,http://twitter.com/maxinemm,maxinemm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Just by chance we found out our daughter had uveitis via an eye test at vision express.  They thought it was cataracts but it is uveitis.  She has had the eyes drops for about a year and there was some improvement.  Her eyes pressure went up so we have had some other drops as well.  However, the specialist at the Sheffield Childrens Hospital has started her yesterday on Methotraxate.  She doesn't seem to be showing any signs of JA as yet and all respects is really fit and healthy.",After attending the hospital last night for Meth training it has put the fear of god into me.  I am really worried about what to expect as side effects and how it might effect her.  Will she definitely get all the side effects?  What are peoples experiences as I am beginning to wonder if I have done the right thing.  However in the face of damage to eye sight I really don't feel we have any choice.

If anyone could give me some advice I would really appreciate it as we are extremely worried.
